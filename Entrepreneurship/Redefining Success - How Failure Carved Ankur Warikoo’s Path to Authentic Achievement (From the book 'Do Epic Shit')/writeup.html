<div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;"><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">For Ankur Warikoo, success was never a linear journey. It was a winding road paved with rejection, self-doubt, and hard-won lessons. Once a people-pleasing 20-something chasing society’s benchmarks, he now sees success as a deeply personal dialogue between ambition and authenticity—a conversation shaped not by trophies, but by scars.</p><h3>Success Is Personal (And So Are the Stumbles)</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Warikoo’s relationship with success began as a series of borrowed scripts. Like many, he chased prestigious degrees, high-paying jobs, and external validation. But repeated failures—rejections from IITs, dropped-out PhD programs, and startup collapses—forced him to rewrite the rules. “Failure wasn’t the opposite of success,” he reflects. “It was the mentor I never knew I needed.”</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Through setbacks, he learned to measure success in micro-victories: outdoing his own expectations, choosing curiosity over comfort, and finding joy in incremental progress. “Breaking your limits without expecting to,” he says, “reveals how much more you’re capable of.”</p><hr><h3>The Unsexy Truth: Grit Over Glamour</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Warikoo’s career defies the myth of overnight success. From failed ventures like his food startup to the collapse of nearbuy, he discovered that persistence isn’t about grand gestures—it’s about showing up, even when the path feels futile. “Mastery is a slow-burn series,” he quips, comparing growth to a Netflix drama that only gets good after a tedious first season.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">For him, authenticity became the anchor. Early attempts at content creation felt hollow until he embraced his unfiltered voice. “Consistency + authenticity isn’t a strategy,” he insists. “It’s survival. People connect with realness, not personas.”</p><hr><h3>A Curriculum of Mistakes: Lessons From His 20s and 30s</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>In His 20s:</strong> Warikoo chased prestige—MBAs, consulting jobs, and “cool” books—while judging others for their life choices. He now cringes at his younger self’s naivety. “I confused being ‘good’ at something with happiness,” he admits. His wake-up call? Realizing that money buys freedom, not fulfillment, and that self-worth crumbles when tied to others’ opinions.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>In His 30s:</strong> Success morphed into a different trap. As an entrepreneur, he prioritized scaling startups over family, equated leadership with control, and tied his identity to investor validation. Layoffs, financial turmoil, and a son who drew him <em>holding a phone</em> forced a reckoning. “Time is the only non-renewable resource,” he says. “Everything else can wait—except the people who matter.”</p><hr><h3>The Failure Résumé: Scars as Credentials</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">At 41, Warikoo wears his failures like medals:</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Rejection from IITs</strong> taught resilience.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>A dropped PhD</strong> freed him to pivot.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Startup implosions</strong> exposed the cost of misplaced priorities.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Maxed credit cards</strong> redefined “wealth” as freedom, not luxury.</p></li></ul><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">His lowest moment? Selling his wife’s gold bangles to buy his son a birthday gift. “Those scars,” he says, “are proof I kept fighting, even when I lost.”</p><hr><h3>The Journey &gt; The Destination</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Today, Warikoo rejects society’s obsession with endpoints. “Life happens in the messy middle,” he argues. Success, for him, is no longer about awards or exits—it’s the freedom to live unapologetically, guided by self-awareness over others’ expectations.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Quoting Jim Carrey, he adds, “I wish everyone could get rich and famous so they’d see that’s not the answer.” His own version? “Regret is heavier than failure. Start <em>today</em>, even if you stumble.”</p><hr><h3>Redefining the Rules</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Warikoo’s story isn’t a blueprint—it’s a permission slip. He urges others to:</p><ol start="1"><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Rewrite their definitions of success</strong> (“Your rules, not the world’s”).</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Embrace multiple identities</strong> (“Why be one person when you can be ten?”).</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Treat mentors like Subway sandwiches</strong> (“Customize them for every life chapter”).</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Let actions speak</strong> (“Luck favors those who make things happen”).</p></li></ol><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">His mantra? <em>“What you become through the process matters more than the outcome.”</em></p><hr><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>PS:</strong> “Scars tell truer stories than résumés,” Warikoo often says. “They’re proof you lived, fought, and grew. Wear them proudly.”</p></div>
