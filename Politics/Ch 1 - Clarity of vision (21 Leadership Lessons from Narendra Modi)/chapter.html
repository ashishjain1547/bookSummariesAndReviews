Clarity of Vision
"To grasp and hold a vision, that is the very essence of successful leadership." ~ Ronald Reagan

History proves that one of the intrinsic traits of any great leader is him being a visionary. While we all have a vision of something or the other, a great leader not only has a vision but also has the trait of transferring his vision to people around him so that it becomes an organisational or a social vision. As is said, people don't follow people but people follow an idea of achievement. When Alexander set his foot on the lands of Asia and defeated the mighty king Darius III of Persia with an army of handful soldiers, the achievement was not just hailed as his own but was projected as a Greek supremacy over the world, though this could only have been achieved for Alexander had a clarity of vision to become a global conqueror.

Similarly when Gandhi picked up a dollop of salt from Dandi or called for Quit India, his vision of free India was resonated with all, for it reflected his single minded agenda of a free India. His acts were not just seen as singular acts but part of the larger plan of freeing India from the clutches of Britishers.

An important aspect of defining one’s vision is that it is unambiguous and simple. Often, leaders of all kinds fall prey to ambiguity and complexity. What needs to be understood is that vision is not a compilation of flowery words which appear good on paper and words, rather it’s the base upon which one lays the foundation of implementation. A simple vision, thus, is not just clear and focused but also conveys a distinct message as to what needs to be achieved by following that vision.

A vision is not just a dream of the leader’s objective. Rather, it also serves as a guiding post to the people who look up to that leader and defines the path that needs to be adopted to achieve that vision.

Having a clear vision of how one wants the future orientation to be, is perhaps the most important leadership quality. A leader in whom the masses have placed their trust naturally has the power to influence and it thus becomes his great responsibility to project a clear vision of what he is working for. This helps provide direction, meaning, enthusiasm and a grand sense of success for all those who are part of that milieu. Clarity breeds understanding; understanding breeds productivity and productivity breeds confidence which in turn breeds desired returns.

Coming out as the most popular leader of the masses of Independent India, Narendra Modi succeeds in projecting himself as a man with a clear sense of purpose. It is not just the highly appealing propaganda he shares, but also confidence in his dream of a developed India focusing on inclusive growth and better governance. His apparent long-term, ‘complete’ vision is what sets him apart as a leader with power to bring and manage the much-needed change that India needs. Millions of Indians have trusted him with this immense responsibility, and that is because Modi was confidently able to display a future image of India, along with sound ideas and schemes to bring that vision to reality.

While campaigning in the Indian General Election 2014, Modi’s party, Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) seemed to be the only one with a defined vision. Even the election campaign goal was clear: attaining at least 272 seats to have majority votes. This vision, in order to be effective, was communicated well in advance to the party as well as the public, by launching it under the name ‘Mission 272’. Effective leaders have this appealing capability to attract followers by giving them something to strive for. In the present times, the people of India desperately wanted change for the better, having been left bamboozled by the Government so far. Selecting Modi to represent them at the highest level had a lot to do with his clarity as to the right way forward for India.

Most would agree that in the decades preceding Modi, India lacked a clear vision for growth and development. Development was often confused with either populist schemes or subsidies based models. The economic model and the governance structure were either oriented towards established populism or managing the Collation Dharma, thus, people in general lacked a clear vision of growth. Modi provided a clear dream in the form of change which is not generic in nature but touched upon specific agendas.

In an even broader perspective, his dreams for India can be taken into account to serve as broad examples of what lies behind his motivation. He seems to have thought of every major aspect that he believes needs attention, in order to make India truly shining. Encompassing an extensive range, his vision includes everything from fostering agricultural research to developing quality infrastructure to financial investments. The focus is on urbanization, education, bringing down corruption and inflation, creating jobs, skill development, use of technology for effectiveness, and doing everything with an inclusive approach. His ‘Brand India’ idea, that professes development in the five T’s: tradition, talent, tourism, technology and trade, also helped generate an image of an India that proudly stands at par with developed economies of the world. Modi gives the example of China, looking at how development of new cities led to their economic prosperity. This idea greatly appeals to the public, especially industrialists, who are quite appreciative of a politician talking about development of infrastructure. The Ambani brothers, among the leading industrialists in India, called Modi “a king among the kings”, appreciating his grand vision and purpose.

Modi’s vision is not just well articulated but also well systematised with all actions taken or projected by him leading back into a single objective of “Making India Great”. This connection helps his target (the citizens of India) to remain connected with his vision. So when he speaks of better roads, better technology, better governance, every citizen of India sees that it’s imperative for making India great. An important aspect of his vision is also to give a benchmark for vision. He speaks about great global nations like Japan and China and how they have emerged as leaders, thus defining the final goal of India to be in the same league. He has a good grasp of entire governance system of India, as ruling a state for 15 years has given him a good understanding of grassroots challenges and thus his vision imbibes grassroots issues in same the breath as national or international issues. His vision is not just a by-product of a dream which may sound frivolous to achieve, but has a solid base of understanding, limitation and clear path of implementation.

As Theodore Hesburgh, President of University of Notre Dame, USA, stated, “The very essence of leadership is that you have to have a vision. It’s got to be a vision you articulate clearly and forcefully on every occasion.” Similarly, Narendra Modi reflects upon his vision at all occasions. This reiteration over time has got deeply embedded not just in mind of Narendra Modi himself but also of the people who have reposed faith in him.

From day one Modi has projected an agenda of development which makes him a representative on which people can pose in their faith for development. He has constantly and evidently hammered the concept of development so much so that the very mention of Narendra Modi now equates with growth and development. This is an important trait for any leader and his leadership message.

This single minded agenda and clarity has indeed been beneficial for him for through this he has warded off and shifted the political discourse towards his own agenda of growth. While his critics challenged his regional credentials or ideological affiliations they could never question his administrative abilities or his vision, which thus played an important role in diffusing his critics and paving a greater connect with his desired takeholders.

His vision doesn’t go by as sham, for he has effectively managed to communicate his ideas about achieving these goals. Through his well-articulated speeches, he has displayed his ideas behind India’s economic development, corruption-free government and what he means by his idea of ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’. Part of what makes him identifiable to the people is his stark detection of problems plaguing the country and its economy. So when a leader professes meaningful solutions to help resolve issues people can associate with, he is the one where the trust of the masses is placed, as is the case of Narendra Modi.

Tracing back to Modi’s early life, parallels can be drawn to his present and his persistence on defining a vision before moving forward. As a child when Modi started attending the daily Shakha organized by RSS, he was perhaps looking for a refuge from the physical bondage of his home life. He is known to have been in search of a distinct identity right from the beginning, drawn in by the discipline and different life of RSS, also being greatly inspired by the authority exhibited by the RSS leader.

Narendra Modi is an exemplary example of a leader with a vision. However, it is important to note that this trait isn’t nurtured overnight. One might not have that sense at all, especially when one is young and yet to explore the world. In the midst of his later years as a teenager and a young adult, Modi too was gripped with non-clarity and confusion about life. Since he was a dedicated worker, he was able to explore his strengths and understand the ways of the world, which helped him develop his own vision for himself. He was never ashamed of performing even the least important tasks, because he had simply to reflect on his long-term vision and know that those were just stepping stones to a better and more powerful future.

Considering the example of Gujarat, where Narendra Modi served as Chief Minister from 2001–2014, it is apparent what a well-defined vision can do. His plans, created well in advance for the future, are so detailed and well-formulated that they are good enough to serve Gujarat till 2030. The changes brought into the state with his policies have brought in investments in Gujarat, which has led to its impressive development.
In order to promote investments in Gujarat, Modi also initiated ‘Vibrant Gujarat’, held by the Government of Gujarat as a biennial investors’ summit. Modi has visualized Gujarat to emerge as a nodal centre in Asia, to serve as a common platform for countries like China, Japan, Thailand and Sri Lanka.

This is part of the grander vision that Modi created for the state of Gujarat, what came to be called as the ‘Gujarat Model’. This model for development has been effective in certain aspects and helped bring about impressive changes in Gujarat, making it one of the top economically growing states in India. Be it agricultural improvements or industrial expansion, Modi had it all laid out in clear terms, what they aim to achieve and how they plan to implement their ideas. This is probably the greatest reason that the vision came to reality. The agri-GDP growth registered during the 2000s saw agriculture in Gujarat growing by 9.8% per annum, compared to the meagre 2% during the 1990s.

As Narendra Modi takes charge of the country as Prime Minister, laying out his vision for India, there’s hope and a certain level of confidence that India will be on the right path to achieve its ideal state. He has vowed to end corruption, make India a manufacturing hub and enable financial and digital inclusion. Modi’s clarity of vision is further indicated by the segmentation of overall goals into smaller, precise goals, which makes it easier to understand where we’re heading. Example, when Modi states that he aims for a ‘Clean India’, he makes it look achievable by providing a timeline (by 2019) and by organizing campaigns (like hosting the World Toilet Summit in Delhi) and providing government support (allocating increased amount of money for toilet construction). Similarly, to achieve his aim of a technologically savvy and inclusive country, Modi has come up with ideas such as the Digital India mission, aimed at transforming India into a digitally empowered knowledge economy. Just like a super-magnet, Modi’s clarity of vision draws him relentlessly forward.

An important trait that has been displayed by the vision of Narendra Modi is that it not just epitomises the vision of modern India but is deep rooted within Indian culture and what our forefathers envisioned. His vision has a unique characteristic of transcending into every aspect of Indian mind-set from basic cleanliness to technical expertise to becoming a global power and as it is simple to comprehend by the common masses. Hence, they imbibe the vision as their own.

Footsteps – Dhirubhai Ambani

Great leaders who have scaled global heights have proved to be stimulated by a larger vision of who they want to become. Their goals are distinct, which helps them stay on track and focus on the right things. One such example of a leader with the persistence on having a clear vision and ideas is business tycoon and founder of Reliance Industries, Dhirubhai Ambani. A man ahead of his times, he dared to dream on a boundless scale, which is something Narendra Modi also symbolizes. Dhirubhai converted Reliance from a small trading house to a large private sector group, listed among Fortune’s ‘World’s Top 500 Companies’. This tremendous growth was possible because of his belief in having a larger than life vision.

Modi's distinct ideas about India's growth and development are parallel with how Dhirubhai imagined the country to be. Convinced that India could become an economic superpower, he wanted Reliance to contribute towards this ideal. Both these leaders understood the importance of investment as a driving tool for development. While Dhirubhai was among the first to discover and believe in the untapped potential of capital markets, Modi has also been emphasizing on generating investments and improving basic infrastructure.

Dhirubhai believed in going forward with your vision in mind, but also emphasized on the importance of 'keeping with the times'. Updating those grand plans with new inputs and taking developments into account, is equally important. This is reflected in Modi as he charts out plans and goals, adopting new practices and revising them to accept what is the most relevant. Just as Dhirubhai, starting off with a humble beginning, created a life backed by exceptional achievements, Modi symbolizes what it means to follow one's vision with confidence, courage and conviction.

An Important similarity between these two leaders is also that both charted a path on their own and overcoming a challenge from established circles. Their vision had a jest of creativity as they discovered newer methods to achieve their objectives. While operating in an overtly protected regime, Dhirubhai could have chosen the path of his contemporaries who were too concentrated in protectionism and secured markets offered to them. Rather, he chose to tap the opportunities of today with a vision for tomorrow. The big business houses of then invested little in R&D or skills or even becoming globally competitive. Many of them thus fell out when the Indian market opened in 1991. Dhirubhai's vision was not just short term, aimed at profit of today, but also long term - becoming globally competitive. Similarly Narendra Modi's vision is not short term, oriented towards achieving smaller improvements in the governance framework, but is long term - making India globally competitive. Both of them formed a unique mix of top-down and bottom-up approach of vision implementation.

In the eighties, Reliance established the Patalganga refinery in record time, which was not just a remarkable business feat but a world class facility to refine petro products at the cheapest price. This was a feat with a vision for future, for Dhirubhai knew that someday or the other when India will be forced to open its markets, then Reliance should be numero uno. He thus undertook investment for the future decades ahead of a change. Similarly, Narendra Modi with his target of reaching at the top post started engaging at national level since 2002- 2003. Sensing the weaker points of BJP in South India, he started visiting those states from 2002-2003 with his speeches being translated in local languages and media interviews being carried in local newspapers. Similarly in most important states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (which cumulatively send the largest number of MPs in Indian Parliament) he started engaging with grassroots cadres. Though it was only a decade later that his name was propped for the top post, yet his long term vision and investment garnered great returns for him with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar returning close to a third of all BJP MPs in the parliament of 2014.

Another point of similarity between the vision of both Dhirubhai and Narendra Modi is its strong economical connect. While one can attribute this to their famous Gujarati genes, yet the vision of Dhirubhai to create value proposition for his shareholders and that of Narendra Modi to put development and economic benefit to citizens at large as the base are indeed closely connected and reflective of each other. Coming from rather humble backgrounds, both understood the fact that true prosperity and larger social or organisational benefits could only be achieved if economic benefits percolate to the lowest strata of their stakeholders. This approach made them obvious leaders upon whom people and shareholders at large could place their faith.

These leaders are accomplished not because they harbour special characteristics, special surname or familial ties, but because they choose to make their lives special. They dare to dream big, have a vision in mind and sincerely work towards realizing that vision."
