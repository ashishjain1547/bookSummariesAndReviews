<p>Good evening friends, today we are going to discuss the book “48 Laws of Power” by Robert Greene. We going to go
    through each law one by one following with the short explanation of each. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 1 </p>
<p>Never Outshine the Master </p>
<p>Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please or impress them, do not go too far in
    displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite – inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear
    more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal: </p>
<p>You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you must be selectively cruel. If your superior is
    a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining him. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 2 </p>
<p>Never put too Much Trust in Friends, Learn how to use Enemies </p>
<p>Be wary of friends-they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled
    and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In
    fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>A man of power, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the sake of appearances it is
    generally preferable to have other people do it for him; friends often do this the best, since their affection for
    him makes them willing to take chances. Also, if your plans go awry for some reason, you can use a friend as a
    convenient scapegoat. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 3 </p>
<p>Conceal your Intentions </p>
<p>Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what
    you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelope them in enough
    smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>No smoke screen, red herring, false sincerity, or any other diversionary device will succeed in concealing your
    intentions if you already have an established reputation for deception. And as you get older and achieve success, it
    often becomes increasingly difficult to disguise your cunning. Everyone knows you practice deception; persist in
    playing naive and you run the risk of seeming the rankest hypocrite, which will severely limit your room to
    maneuver. In such cases it is better to own up, to appear the honest rogue, or, better, the repentant rogue. Not
    only will you be admired for your frankness, but, most wonderful and strange of all, you will be able to continue
    your stratagems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 4 </p>
<p>Always Say Less than Necessary </p>
<p>When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in
    control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and
    sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say
    something foolish. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion and even insecurity, especially in your
    superiors; a vague or ambiguous comment can open you up to interpretations you had not bargained for. Silence and
    saying less than necessary must be practiced with caution, then, and in the right situations. It is occasionally
    wiser to imitate the court jester, who plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks and
    entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a fool. Also, words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke
    screen for any deception you might practice. By bending your listener’s ear with talk, you can distract and
    mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less suspicious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as
    sly and manipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the reverse of the silent policy employed by the
    powerful: By talking more, and making yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can practice
    deception with greater ease.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 5 </p>
<p>So Much Depends on Reputation – Guard it with your Life </p>
<p>Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once you slip, however,
    you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to
    potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in
    their own reputations. </p>
<p>Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 6 </p>
<p>Court Attention at all Cost </p>
<p>Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd,
    then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention by
    appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious, than the bland and timid masses. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 7 </p>
<p>Get others to do the Work for you, but Always Take the Credit </p>
<p>Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance save
    you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will
    be forgotten and you will be remembered. </p>
<p>Never do yourself what others can do for you. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>There are times when taking the credit for work that others have done is not the wise course: If your power is not
    firmly enough established, you will seem to be pushing people out of the limelight. To be a brilliant exploiter of
    talent your position must be unshakable, or you will be accused of deception.</p>
<p>Be sure you know when letting other people share the credit serves your purpose. It is especially important to not be
    greedy when you have a master above you. President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to the People’s Republic of China
    was originally his idea, but it might never have come off but for the deft diplomacy of Henry Kissinger. Nor would
    it have been as successful without Kissinger’s skills. Still, when the time came to take credit, Kissinger adroitly
    let Nixon take the lion’s share. Knowing that the truth would come out later, he was careful not to jeopardize his
    standing in the short term by hogging the limelight. Kissinger played the game expertly: He took credit for the work
    of those below him while graciously giving credit for his own labors to those above. That is the way to play the
    game.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 8 </p>
<p>Make other People come to you – use Bait if Necessary </p>
<p>When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to
    you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains – then attack. You hold the cards. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Although it is generally the wiser policy to make others exhaust themselves chasing you, there are opposite cases
    where striking suddenly and aggressively at the enemy so demoralizes him that his energies sink. Instead of making
    others come to you, you go to them, force the issue, take the lead. Fast attack can be an awesome weapon, for it
    forces the other person to react without the time to think or plan. With no time to think, people make errors of
    judgment, and are thrown on the defensive. This tactic is the obverse of waiting and baiting, but it serves the same
    function: You make your enemy respond on your terms.</p>
<p>Men like Cesare Borgia and Napoleon used the element of speed to intimidate and control. A rapid and unforeseen move
    is terrifying and demoralizing. You must choose your tactics depending on the situation. If you have time on your
    side, and know that you and your enemies are at least at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them
    come to you. If time is against you—your enemies are weaker, and waiting will only give them the chance to
    recover—give them no such chance. Strike quickly and they have nowhere to go. As the boxer Joe Louis put it, “He can
    run, but he can’t hide.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 9 </p>
<p>Win through your Actions, Never through Argument </p>
<p>Any momentary triumph you think gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you
    stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to
    agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Verbal argument has one vital use in the realm of power: To distract and cover your tracks when you are practicing
    deception or are caught in a lie. In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all the conviction you can
    muster. Draw the other person into an argument to distract them from your deceptive move. When caught in a lie, the
    more emotional and certain you appear, the less likely it seems that you are lying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 10 </p>
<p>Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky </p>
<p>You can die from someone else’s misery – emotional states are as infectious as disease. You may feel you are helping
    the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on
    themselves; they will also draw it on you. </p>
<p>Associate with the happy and fortunate instead. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 11 </p>
<p>Learn to Keep People Dependent on You </p>
<p>To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you
    have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them
    enough so that they can do without you. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The weakness of making others depend on you is that you are in some measure dependent on them. But trying to move
    beyond that point means getting rid of those above you—it means standing alone, depending on no one. Such is the
    monopolistic drive of a J. P. Morgan or a John D. Rockefeller—to drive out all competition, to be in complete
    control. If you can corner the market, so much the better.</p>
<p>No such independence comes without a price. You are forced to isolate yourself. Monopolies often turn inward and
    destroy themselves from the internal pressure. They also stir up powerful resentment, making their enemies bond
    together to fight them. The drive for complete control is often ruinous and fruitless. Interdependence remains the
    law, independence a rare and often fatal exception. Better to place yourself in a position of mutual dependence,
    then, and to follow this critical law rather than look for its reversal. You will not have the unbearable pressure
    of being on top, and the master above you will in essence be your slave, for he will depend on you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 12 </p>
<p>Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm your Victim </p>
<p>One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. Open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity
    bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in their armor,
    you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gift – a Trojan horse – will serve the same purpose. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>When you have a history of deceit behind you, no amount of honesty, generosity, or kindness will fool people. In
    fact, it will only call attention to itself. Once people have come to see you as deceitful, to act honest all of a
    sudden is simply suspicious. In these cases, it is better to play the rogue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 13 </p>
<p>When Asking for Help, Appeal to People’s Self-Interest, Never to their Mercy or Gratitude </p>
<p>If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He will
    find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will
    benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be
    gained for himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Some people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and ignoble. They actually prefer to be able to
    exercise charity, mercy, and justice, which are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg them for help,
    you emphasize their power and position. They are strong enough to need nothing from you except the chance to feel
    superior. This is the wine that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce you to powerful
    people—provided, of course, that all this is done in public, and for a good cause (usually the more public, the
    better). Not everyone, then, can be approached through cynical self-interest. Some people will be put off by it,
    because they don’t want to seem to be motivated by such things. They need opportunities to display their good heart.
</p>
<p>Do not be shy. Give them that opportunity. It’s not as if you are conning them by asking for help—it is really their
    pleasure to give, and to be seen giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful people and figure out
    what makes them tick. When they ooze greed, do not appeal to their charity. When they want to look charitable and
    noble, do not appeal to their greed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 14 </p>
<p>Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy </p>
<p>Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead.
    Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get
    people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Information is critical to power, but just as you spy on other people, you must be prepared for them to spy on you.
    One of the most potent weapons in the battle for information, then, is giving out false information. As Winston
    Churchill said, “Truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.” You must surround
    yourself with such a bodyguard, so that your truth cannot be penetrated. By planting the information of your choice,
    you control the game.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 15 </p>
<p>Crush your Enemy Totally </p>
<p>All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have learned
    this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out.
    More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek
    revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>This law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes happen that it is better to let your enemies destroy
    themselves, if such a thing is possible, than to make them suffer by your hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 16 </p>
<p>Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor </p>
<p>Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If
    you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more
    admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>This law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained. The need to withdraw only comes after you have
    established your presence; leave too early and you do not increase your respect, you are simply forgotten. When you
    are first entering onto the world’s stage, create an image that is recognizable, reproducible, and is seen
    everywhere. Until that status is attained, absence is dangerous—instead of fanning the flames, it will extinguish
    them.</p>
<p>In love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you have surrounded the other with your image, been
    seen by him or her everywhere. Everything must remind your lover of your presence, so that when you do choose to be
    away, the lover will always be thinking of you, will always be seeing you in his or her mind’s eye.</p>
<p>Remember: In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but omnipresent. Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will
    be missed in its absence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 17 </p>
<p>Keep Others in Suspended Terror: Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability </p>
<p>Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people’s actions. Your
    predictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to
    have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your
    moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Sometimes predictability can work in your favor: By creating a pattern for people to be familiar and comfortable
    with, you can lull them to sleep. They have prepared everything according to their preconceived notions about you.
    You can use this in several ways: First, it sets up a smoke screen, a comfortable front behind which you can carry
    on deceptive actions. Second, it allows you on rare occasions to do something completely against the pattern,
    unsettling your opponent so deeply he will fall to the ground without being pushed.</p>
<p>A warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes, especially if you are in a subordinate position. There
    are times when it is better to let people feel comfortable and settled around you than to disturb them. Too much
    unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness, or even of some more serious psychic problem. Patterns
    are powerful, and you can terrify people by disrupting them. Such power should only be used judiciously.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 18 </p>
<p>Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself – Isolation is Dangerous </p>
<p>The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere – everyone has to protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest.
    But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from – it cuts you off from valuable information, it
    makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people find allies, mingle. You are shielded
    from your enemies by the crowd. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>It is hardly ever right and propitious to choose isolation. Without keeping an ear on what is happening in the
    streets, you will be unable to protect yourself. About the only thing that constant human contact cannot facilitate
    is thought. The weight of society’s pressure to conform, and the lack of distance from other people, can make it
    impossible to think clearly about what is going on around you. As a temporary recourse, then, isolation can help you
    to gain perspective. Many a serious thinker has been produced in prisons, where we have nothing to do but think.
    Machiavelli could write The Prince only once he found himself in exile and isolated on a farm far from the political
    intrigues of Florence.</p>
<p>The danger is, however, that this kind of isolation will sire all kinds of strange and perverted ideas. You may gain
    perspective on the larger picture, but you lose a sense of your own smallness and limitations. Also, the more
    isolated you are, the harder it is to break out of your isolation when you choose to—it sinks you deep into its
    quicksand without your noticing. If you need time to think, then, choose isolation only as a last resort, and only
    in small doses. Be careful to keep your way back into society open.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 19 </p>
<p>Know Who You’re Dealing with – Do Not Offend the Wrong Person </p>
<p>There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your
    strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking
    revenge. They are wolves in lambs’ clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then – never offend or
    deceive the wrong person. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 20 </p>
<p>Do Not Commit to Anyone </p>
<p>It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining your
    independence, you become the master of others – playing people against one another, making them pursue you. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Both parts of this law will turn against you if you take it too far. The game proposed here is delicate and
    difficult. If you play too many parties against one another, they will see through the maneuver and will gang up on
    you. If you keep your growing number of suitors waiting too long, you will inspire not desire but distrust. People
    will start to lose interest. Eventually you may find it worthwhile to commit to one side—if only for appearances’
    sake, to prove you are capable of attachment.</p>
<p>Even then, however, the key will be to maintain your inner independence—to keep yourself from getting emotionally
    involved. Preserve the unspoken option of being able to leave at any moment and reclaim your freedom if the side you
    are allied with starts to collapse. The friends you made while you were being courted will give you plenty of places
    to go once you jump ship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 21 </p>
<p>Play a Sucker to Catch a Sucker – Seem Dumber than your Mark </p>
<p>No one likes feeling stupider than the next persons. The trick, is to make your victims feel smart – and not just
    smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all
    times. If people inadvertently learn the truth—that you are actually much smarter than you look—they will admire you
    more for being discreet than for making your brilliance show. At the start of your climb to the top, of course, you
    cannot play too stupid: You may want to let your bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter than the
    competition around you. As you climb the ladder, however, you should to some degree try to dampen your brilliance.
</p>
<p>There is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite—when you can cover up a deception with a show of
    intelligence. In matters of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to have authority and
    knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can be very useful in getting you out of a scrape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 22 </p>
<p>Use the Surrender Tactic: Transform Weakness into Power </p>
<p>When you are weaker, never fight for honor’s sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover,
    time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction of
    fighting and defeating you – surrender first. By turning the other cheek, you infuriate and unsettle him. Make
    surrender a tool of power. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The point of surrendering is to save your hide for a later date when you can reassert yourself. It is precisely to
    avoid martyrdom that one surrenders, but there are times when the enemy will not relent, and martyrdom seems the
    only way out. Furthermore, if you are willing to die, others may gain power and inspiration from your example. Yet
    martyrdom, surrender’s reversal, is a messy, inexact tactic, and is as violent as the aggression it combats. For
    every famous martyr there are thousands more who have inspired neither a religion nor a rebellion, so that if
    martyrdom does sometimes grant a certain power, it does so unpredictably. More important, you will not be around to
    enjoy that power, such as it is. And there is finally something selfish and arrogant about martyrs, as if they felt
    their followers were less important than their own glory. </p>
<p>When power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law’s reversal. Leave martyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back
    your way eventually, and you should stay alive to see it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 23 </p>
<p>Concentrate Your Forces </p>
<p>Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by finding a
    rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another – intensity defeats extensity
    every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you
    milk for a long time to come. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>There are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the proper tactical move. Fighting the
    Nationalists for control of China, Mao Tse-tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts, using
    sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often suitable for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a
    crucial principle of guerrilla warfare. When fighting a stronger army, concentrating your forces only makes you an
    easier target—better to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate your enemy with the elusiveness of your presence.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tying yourself to a single source of power has one preeminent danger: If that person dies, leaves, or falls from
    grace, you suffer. This is what happened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope Alexander VI.
    It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and wars to wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps
    from poison), Cesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the years, and was now without his
    father’s protection. In cases when you may need protection, then, it is often wise to entwine yourself around
    several sources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of great tumult and violent change, or
    when your enemies are numerous. The more patrons and masters you serve the less risk you run if one of them falls
    from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off against the other. Even if you concentrate on the
    single source of power, you still must practice caution, and prepare for the day when your master or patron is no
    longer there to help you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, being too single-minded in purpose can make you an intolerable bore, especially in the arts. The Renaissance
    painter Paolo Uccello was so obsessed with perspective that his paintings look lifeless and contrived. Whereas
    Leonardo da Vinci interested himself in everything—architecture, painting, warfare, sculpture, mechanics. Diffusion
    was the source of his power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on the side of
    intensity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 24 </p>
<p>Play the Perfect Courtier </p>
<p>The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has
    mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the mot oblique
    and graceful manner. Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in
    the court. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 25 </p>
<p>Re-Create Yourself </p>
<p>Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands
    attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define if for
    you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions – your power will be enhanced and your
    character will seem larger than life. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 26 </p>
<p>Keep Your Hands Clean </p>
<p>You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. Maintain
    such a spotless appearance by using others as scapegoats and cat’s-paws to disguise your involvement. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The cat’s-paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme caution and delicacy. They are like screens that hide your
    own involvement in dirty work from the public; if at any moment the screen is lifted and you are seen as the
    manipulator, the puppet master, the whole dynamic turns around—your hand will be seen everywhere, and you will be
    blamed for misfortunes you may have had nothing to do with. Once the truth is revealed, events will snowball beyond
    your control.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have to use a cat’s-paw or a scapegoat in an action of great consequence, be very careful: Too much can go
    wrong. It is often wiser to use such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes or miscalculations will cause
    no serious harm. Finally, there are moments when it is advantageous to not disguise your involvement or
    responsibility, but rather to take the blame yourself for some mistake. If you have power and are secure in it, you
    should sometimes play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness from those weaker than you. It is
    the ploy of the king who makes a show of his own sacrifices for the good of the people. Similarly, upon occasion you
    may want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fear and trembling in your subordinates. Instead
    of the cat‘s-paw you show your own mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If you play it
    too often, fear will turn into resentment and hatred. Before you know it, such emotions will spark a vigorous
    opposition that will someday bring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat’s-paw—it is far safer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 27 </p>
<p>Play on People’s Need to Believe to Create a Cult like Following </p>
<p>People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a
    cause, a new faith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and
    clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf. In the
    absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold power. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>One reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to deceive than an individual, and turns over to you
    that much more power. This comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the group sees through you, you will find
    yourself facing not one deceived soul but an angry crowd that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once followed
    you. The charlatans constantly faced this danger, and were always ready to move out of town as it inevitably became
    clear that their elixirs did not work and their ideas were sham. Too slow and they paid with their lives. In playing
    with the crowd, you are playing with fire, and must constantly keep an eye out for any sparks of doubt, any enemies
    who will turn the crowd against you. When you play with the emotions of a crowd, you have to know how to adapt,
    attuning yourself instantaneously to all of the moods and desires that a group will produce. Use spies, be on top of
    everything, and keep your bags packed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For this reason, you may often prefer to deal with people one by one. Isolating them from their normal milieu can
    have the same effect as putting them in a group—it makes them more prone to suggestion and intimidation. Choose the
    right sucker and if he eventually sees through you he may prove easier to escape than a crowd.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 28 </p>
<p>Enter Action with Boldness </p>
<p>If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution.
    Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected
    with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Boldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions. It is a tactical instrument, to be used at the
    right moment. Plan and think ahead, and make the final element the bold move that will bring you success. In other
    words, since boldness is a learned response, it is also one that you learn to control and utilize at will. To go
    through life armed only with audacity would be tiring and also fatal. You would offend too many people, as is proven
    by those who cannot control their boldness. One such person was Lola Montez; her audacity brought her triumphs and
    led to her seduction of the king of Bavaria. But since she could never rein in her boldness, it also led to her
    downfall—in Bavaria, in England, wherever she turned. It crossed the border between boldness and the appearance of
    cruelty, even insanity. Ivan the Terrible suffered the same fate: When the power of boldness brought him success, he
    stuck to it, to the point where it became a lifelong pattern of violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell
    when boldness was appropriate and when it was not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Timidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often benefit, however, by being able to feign it. At that
    point, of course, it is no longer timidity but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in with your show of
    shyness, all the better to pounce on them boldly later.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 29 </p>
<p>Plan All the Way to the End </p>
<p>The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and
    twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end you will
    not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the
    future by thinking far ahead. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>It is a cliché among strategists that your plan must include alternatives and have a degree of flexibility. That is
    certainly true. If you are locked into a plan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with sudden shifts of fortune.
    Once you have examined the future possibilities and decided on your target, you must build in alternatives and be
    open to new routes toward your goal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most people, however, lose less from over-planning and rigidity than from vagueness and a tendency to improvise
    constantly in the face of circumstance. There is no real purpose in contemplating a reversal to this Law, then, for
    no good can come from refusing to think far into the future and planning to the end. If you are clear- and
    far-thinking enough, you will understand that the future is uncertain, and that you must be open to adaptation. Only
    having a clear objective and a far-reaching plan allows you that freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 30 </p>
<p>Make your Accomplishments Seem Effortless </p>
<p>Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the
    clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the temptation
    of revealing how hard you work – it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against
    you. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The secrecy with which you surround your actions must seem lighthearted in spirit. A zeal to conceal your work
    creates an unpleasant, almost paranoiac impression: you are taking the game too seriously. Houdini was careful to
    make the concealment of his tricks seem a game, all part of the show. Never show your work until it is finished, but
    if you put too much effort into keeping it under wraps you will be like the painter Pontormo, who spent the last
    years of his life hiding his frescoes from the public eye and only succeeded in driving himself mad. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Always keep your sense of humor about yourself. There are also times when revealing the inner workings of your
    projects can prove worthwhile. It all depends on your audience’s taste, and on the times in which you operate. P. T.
    Barnum recognized that his public wanted to feel involved in his shows, and that understanding his tricks delighted
    them, partly, perhaps, because implicitly debunking people who kept their sources of power hidden from the masses
    appealed to America’s democratic spirit. The public also appreciated the showman’s humor and honesty. Barnum took
    this to the extreme of publicizing his own humbuggery in his popular autobiography, written when his career was at
    its height.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As long as the partial disclosure of tricks and techniques is carefully planned, rather than the result of an
    uncontrollable need to blab, it is the ultimate in cleverness. It gives the audience the illusion of being superior
    and involved, even while much of what you do remains concealed from them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 31 </p>
<p>Control the Options: Get Others to Play with the Cards you Deal </p>
<p>The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in control,
    but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Force them
    to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a
    dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Controlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise yourself as the agent of power and punishment. The tactic
    works best, then, for those whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly without incurring suspicion,
    resentment, and anger. Even as a general rule, however, it is rarely wise to be seen as exerting power directly and
    forcefully, no matter how secure or strong you are. It is usually more elegant and more effective to give people the
    illusion of choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, by limiting other people’s options you sometimes limit your own. There are situations in which it
    is to your advantage to allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate, you give yourself
    rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan your deceptions. The nineteenth-century banker James
    Rothschild liked this method: He felt that if he tried to control his opponents’ movements, he lost the chance to
    observe their strategy and plan a more effective course. The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the
    more forcefully he could act against them in the long run.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 32 </p>
<p>Play to People’s Fantasies </p>
<p>The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are
    prepared for the anger that comes for disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can
    manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great
    power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>If there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there is also danger. Fantasy usually contains an
    element of play—the public half realizes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the
    entertainment and the temporary diversion from the everyday that you are providing. So keep it light—never come too
    close to the place where you are actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely hazardous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After Bragadino established himself in Munich, he found that the sober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy
    than the temperamental Venetians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he needed it desperately to rescue him
    from the hopeless mess he was in. As Bragadino played his familiar waiting game, accepting gifts and expecting
    patience, the public grew angry. Money was being spent and was yielding no results. In 1592 the Bavarians demanded
    justice, and eventually Bragadino found himself swinging from the gallows. As before, he had promised and had not
    delivered, but this time he had misjudged the forbearance of his hosts, and his inability to fulfill their fantasy
    proved fatal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is always fantastical. It certainly contrasts with
    reality, but reality itself is sometimes so theatrical and stylized that fantasy becomes a desire for simple things.
    The image Abraham Lincoln created of himself, for example, as a homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the
    common man’s president.</p>
<p></p>
<p>P. T. Barnum created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwarf who dressed up as famous leaders of the past, such as
    Napoleon, and lampooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to Queen Victoria, by appealing to the
    fantasy of the time: Enough of the vainglorious rulers of history, the common man knows best. Tom Thumb reversed the
    familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange and unknown becomes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law,
    for underlying it was the fantasy that the simple man is without problems, and is happier than the powerful and the
    rich.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully maintained their distance. Should you play with such a
    fantasy, you too must carefully cultivate distance and not allow your “common” persona to become too familiar or it
    will not project as fantasy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 33 </p>
<p>Discover Each Man’s Thumbscrew </p>
<p>Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion
    or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn to your
    advantage. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Playing on people’s weakness has one significant danger: You may stir up an action you cannot control.</p>
<p>In your games of power, you always look several steps ahead and plan accordingly. And you exploit the fact that other
    people are more emotional and incapable of such foresight. But when you play on their vulnerabilities, the areas
    over which they have least control, you can unleash emotions that will upset your plans. Push timid people into bold
    action and they may go too far; answer their need for attention or recognition and they may need more than you want
    to give them. The helpless, childish element you are playing on can turn against you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The more emotional the weakness, the greater the potential danger. Know the limits to this game, then, and never get
    carried away by your control over your victims. You are after power, not the thrill of control.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 34 </p>
<p>Be Royal in your Own Fashion: Act like a King to be treated like one </p>
<p>The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated; In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will
    make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By acting regally
    and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown. </p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set yourself apart from other people, but if you take this
    too far it will be your undoing. Never make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humiliating people.
    Also, it is never a good idea to loom too high above the crowd—you make an easy target. And there are times when an
    aristocratic pose is eminently dangerous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power through affecting a kind of earthy vulgarity, which will
    prove amusing by its extreme-ness. But to the extent that you win this game by going beyond the limits, separating
    yourself from other people by appearing even more vulgar than they are, the game is dangerous: There will always be
    people more vulgar than you, and you will easily be replaced the following season by someone younger and worse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 35 </p>
<p>Master the Art of Timing </p>
<p>Never seem to be in a hurry – hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself, and over time. Always seem patient,
    as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the
    spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and
    to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 36 </p>
<p>Disdain Things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best Revenge </p>
<p>By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the
    stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is
    sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less
    interest you reveal, the more superior you seem. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>You must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy. Most small troubles will vanish on their own if you leave
    them be; but some will grow and fester unless you attend to them. Ignore a person of inferior stature and the next
    time you look he has become a serious rival, and your contempt has made him vengeful as well. The great princes of
    Renaissance Italy chose to ignore Cesare Borgia at the outset of his career as a young general in the army of his
    father, Pope Alexander VI. By the time they paid attention it was too late—the cub was now a lion, gobbling up
    chunks of Italy. Often, then, while you show contempt publicly you will also need to keep an eye on the problem
    privately, monitoring its status and making sure it goes away. Do not let it become a cancerous cell.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Develop the skill of sensing problems when they are still small and taking care of them before they become
    intractable. Learn to distinguish between the potentially disastrous and the mildly irritating, the nuisance that
    will quietly go away on its own. In either case, though, never completely take your eye off it. As long as it is
    alive it can smolder and spark into life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 37 </p>
<p>Create Compelling Spectacles </p>
<p>Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power – everyone responds to them. Stage spectacles
    for those around you, then full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. Dazzled by
    appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 38 </p>
<p>Think as you like but Behave like others </p>
<p>If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will
    think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making
    them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with
    tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The only time it is worth standing out is when you already stand out—when you have achieved an unshakable position of
    power, and can display your difference from others as a sign of the distance between you. As president of the United
    States, Lyndon Johnson would sometimes hold meetings while he sat on the toilet. Since no one else either could or
    would claim such a “privilege,” Johnson was showing people that he did not have to observe the protocols and
    niceties of others. The Roman emperor Caligula played the same game: He would wear a woman’s negligee, or a
    bathrobe, to receive important visitors. He even went so far as to have his horse elected consul. But it backfired,
    for the people hated Caligula, and his gestures eventually brought his overthrow. The truth is that even those who
    attain the heights of power would be better off at least affecting the common touch, for at some point they may need
    popular support.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, there is always a place for the gadfly, the person who successfully defies custom and mocks what has grown
    lifeless in a culture. Oscar Wilde, for example, achieved considerable social power on this foundation: He made it
    clear that he disdained the usual ways of doing things, and when he gave public readings his audiences not only
    expected him to insult them but welcomed it. We notice, however, that his eccentric role eventually destroyed him.
    Even had he come to a better end, remember that he possessed an unusual genius: Without his gift to amuse and
    delight, his barbs would simply have offended people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 39 </p>
<p>Stir up Waters to Catch Fish </p>
<p>Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you can make
    your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies off-balance: Find the
    chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>When playing with people’s emotions you have to be careful. Study the enemy beforehand: Some fish are best left at
    the bottom of the pond. The leaders of the city of Tyre, capital of ancient Phoenicia, felt confident they could
    withstand Alexander the Great, who had conquered the Orient but had not attacked their city, which stood well
    protected on the water. They sent ambassadors to Alexander saying that although they would recognize him as emperor
    they would not allow him or his forces to enter Tyre. This of course enraged him, and he immediately mounted a
    siege. For four months the city withstood him, and finally he decided that the struggle was not worth it, and that
    he would come to terms with the Tyrians. But they, feeling that they had already baited Alexander and gotten away
    with it, and confident that they could withstand him, refused to negotiate—in fact they killed his messengers. This
    pushed Alexander over the edge. Now it did not matter to him how long the siege lasted or how large an army it
    needed; he had the resources, and would do whatever it took. He remounted his assault so strenuously that he
    captured Tyre within days, burned it to the ground, and sold its people into slavery. You can bait the powerful and
    get them to commit and divide their forces as Sun Pin did, but test the waters first. Find the gap in their
    strength. If there is no gap—if they are impossibly strong—you have nothing to gain and everything to lose by
    provoking them. Choose carefully whom you bait, and never stir up the sharks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, there are times when a well-timed burst of anger can do you good, but your anger must be manufactured and
    under your control. Then you can determine exactly how and on whom it will fall. Never stir up reactions that will
    work against you in the long run. And use your thunder-bolts rarely, to make them the more intimidating and
    meaningful. Whether purposefully staged or not, if your outbursts come too often, they will lose their power.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 40 </p>
<p>Despise the Free Lunch </p>
<p>What is offered for free is dangerous – it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth, is
    worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise to
    pay the full price – there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating,
    for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The powerful never forget that what is offered for free is inevitably a trick. Friends who offer favors without
    asking for payment will later want something far dearer than the money you would have paid them. The bargain has
    hidden problems, both material and psychological. Learn to pay, then, and to pay well. On the other hand, this Law
    offers great opportunities for swindling and deception if you apply it from the other side. Dangling the lure of a
    free lunch is the con artist’s stock in trade.</p>
<p></p>
<p>No man was better at this than the most successful con artist of our age, Joseph Weil, a.k.a. “The Yellow Kid.” The
    Yellow Kid learned early that what made his swindles possible was his fellow humans’ greed. “This desire to get
    something for nothing,” he once wrote, “has been very costly to many people who have dealt with me and with other
    con men.... When people learn—as I doubt they will—that they can’t get something for nothing, crime will diminish
    and we shall all live in greater harmony.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the years Weil devised many ways to seduce people with the prospect of easy money. He would hand out “free” real
    estate—who could resist such an offer?—and then the suckers would learn they had to pay $25 to register the sale.
    Since the land was free, it seemed worth the high fee, and the Yellow Kid would make thousands of dollars on the
    phony registration. In exchange he would give his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he would tell suckers about a
    fixed horse race, or a stock that would earn 200 percent in a few weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the
    sucker’s eyes open wide at the thought of a free lunch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 41 </p>
<p>Avoid Stepping into a Great Man’s Shoes </p>
<p>What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. If you succeed a great man or have
    a famous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get lost in their
    shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making: Establish your own name and identity by changing course. Slay the
    overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if it is chosen as a trick, a tactic that can be
    discarded once it has brought you power. Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious grand-uncle
    Napoleon Bonaparte to help him become first president and then emperor of France. Once on the throne, however, he
    did not stay tied to the past; he quickly showed how different his reign would be, and was careful to keep the
    public from expecting him to attain the heights that Bonaparte had attained. The past often has elements worth
    appropriating, qualities that would be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even Alexander the
    Great recognized and was influenced by his father’s skill in organizing an army. Making a display of doing things
    differently from your predecessor can make you seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your actions have a
    logic of their own.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joseph II, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a show of doing the exact opposite of his mother—dressing
    like an ordinary citizen, staying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the “people’s emperor.” Maria Theresa, on
    the other hand, had been regal and aristocratic. The problem was that she had also been beloved, an empress who
    ruled wisely after years of learning the hard way. If you have the kind of intelligence and instinct that will point
    you in the right direction, playing the rebel will not be dangerous. But if you are mediocre, as Joseph II was in
    comparison to his mother, you are better off learning from your predecessor’s knowledge and experience, which are
    based on something real.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, it is often wise to keep an eye on the young, your future rivals in power. Just as you try to rid yourself
    of your father, they will soon play the same trick on you, denigrating everything you have accomplished. Just as you
    rise by rebelling against the past, keep an eye on those rising from below, and never give them the chance to do the
    same to you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bernini was a master at sniffing out younger potential rivals and
    keeping them in his shadow. One day a young stonemason named Francesco Borromini showed Bernini his architectural
    sketches. Recognizing his talent immediately, Bernini instantly hired Borromini as his assistant, which delighted
    the young man but was actually only a tactic to keep him close at hand, so that he could play psychological games on
    him and create in him a kind of inferiority complex. And indeed, despite Borromini’s brilliance, Bernini has the
    greater fame. His strategy with Borromini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing that the great sculptor Alessandro
    Algardi, for example, would eclipse him in fame, he arranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his
    assistant. And any assistant who rebelled against Bernini and tried to strike out on his own would find his career
    ruined.</p>

<p>Strike the Shepherd and the Sheep will Scatter </p>
<p>Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual – the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoned of
    goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the
    troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them – they are irredeemable. Neutralize their
    influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>“Any harm you do to a man should be done in such a way that you need not fear his revenge,” writes Machiavelli. If
    you act to isolate your enemy, make sure he lacks the means to repay the favor. If you apply this Law, in other
    words, apply it from a position of superiority, so that you have nothing to fear from his resentment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln’s successor as U.S. president, saw Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his
    government. So he isolated Grant, as a prelude to forcing him out. This only enraged the great general, however, who
    responded by forming a support base in the Republican party and going on to become the next president. It would have
    been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And
    so you may often find it better to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to risk creating an
    angry enemy. Keeping them close, you can secretly whittle away at their support base, so that when the time comes to
    cut them loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing what hit them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 43 </p>
<p>Work on the Hearts and Minds of Others </p>
<p>Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to move in
    your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to operate on
    their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions, playing on what
    they hold dear and what they fear. Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to hate you. </p>

<p>Law 44 </p>
<p>Disarm and Infuriate with the Mirror Effect </p>
<p>The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for deception: When you mirror your enemies, doing
    exactly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them
    overreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values;
    by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of Mirror Effect. </p>

<p>Law 45 </p>
<p>Preach the Need for Change, but Never Reform too much at Once </p>
<p>Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of habit.
    Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are new to a position of power, or an outsider
    trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is necessary, make it
    feel like a gentle improvement on the past. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in the recent past was painful and harsh, it is
    self-destructive to associate yourself with it. When Napoleon came to power, the French Revolution was fresh in
    everyone’s minds. If the court that he established had borne any resemblance to the lavish court of Louis XVI and
    Marie- Antoinette, his courtiers would have spent all their time worrying about their own necks. Instead, Napoleon
    established a court remarkable for its sobriety and lack of ostentation. It was the court of a man who valued work
    and military virtues. This new form seemed appropriate and reassuring.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In other words, pay attention to the times. But understand: If you make a bold change from the past, you must avoid
    at all costs the appearance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Even an ugly recent history will seem
    preferable to an empty space. Fill that space immediately with new rituals and forms. Soothing and growing familiar,
    these will secure your position among the masses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, the arts, fashion, and technology would seem to be areas in which power would come from creating a radical
    rupture with the past and appearing cutting edge. Indeed, such a strategy can bring great power, but it has many
    dangers. It is inevitable that your innovations will be outdone by someone else. You have little control— someone
    younger and fresher moves in a sudden new direction, making your bold innovation of yesterday seem tiresome and tame
    today. You are forever playing catchup; your power is tenuous and short-lived. You want a power built on something
    more solid. Using the past, tinkering with tradition, playing with convention to subvert it will give your creations
    something more than a momentary appeal. Periods of dizzying change disguise the fact that a yearning for the past
    will inevitably creep back in. In the end, using the past for your own purposes will bring you more power than
    trying to cut it out completely—a futile and self-destructive endeavor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 46 </p>
<p>Never appear too Perfect </p>
<p>Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or
    weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices,
    in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with
    impunity. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>The reason for being careful with the envious is that they are so indirect, and will find innumerable ways to
    undermine you. But treading carefully around them will often only make their envy worse. They sense that you are
    being cautious, and it registers as yet another sign of your superiority. That is why you must act before envy takes
    root.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once envy is there, however, whether through your fault or not, it is sometimes best to affect the opposite approach:
    Display the utmost disdain for those who envy you. Instead of hiding your perfection, make it obvious. Make every
    new triumph an opportunity to make the envious squirm. Your good fortune and power become their living hell. If you
    attain a position of unimpeachable power, their envy will have no effect on you, and you will have the best revenge
    of all: They are trapped in envy while you are free in your power.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is how Michelangelo triumphed over the venomous architect Bramante, who turned Pope Julius against
    Michelangelo’s design for his tomb. Bramante envied Michelangelo’s godlike skills, and to this one triumph—the
    aborted tomb project—he thought to add another, by pushing the pope to commission Michelangelo to paint the murals
    in the Sistine Chapel. The project would take years, during which Michelangelo would accomplish no more of his
    brilliant sculptures. Furthermore, Bramante considered Michelangelo not nearly as skilled in painting as in
    sculpture. The chapel would spoil his image as the perfect artist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michelangelo saw the trap and wanted to turn down the commission, but he could not refuse the pope, so he accepted it
    without complaint. Then, however, he used Bramante’s envy to spur him to greater heights, making the Sistine Chapel
    his most perfect work of all. Every time Bramante heard of it or saw it, he felt more oppressed by his own envy—the
    sweetest and most lasting revenge you can exact on the envious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 47 </p>
<p>Do not go Past the Mark you Aimed for; In Victory, Learn when to Stop </p>
<p>The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can
    push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. Do not allow
    success to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach
    it, stop. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>As Machiavelli says, either destroy a man or leave him alone entirely. Inflicting half punishment or mild injury will
    only create an enemy whose bitterness will grow with time, and who will take revenge. When you beat an enemy, then,
    make your victory complete. Crush him into nonexis tence. In the moment of victory, you do not restrain yourself
    from crushing the enemy you have defeated, but rather from needlessly advancing against others. Be merciless with
    your enemy, but do not create new enemies by overreaching.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are some who become more cautious than ever after a victory, which they see as just giving them more
    possessions to worry about and protect. Your caution after victory should never make you hesitate, or lose momentum,
    but rather act as a safeguard against rash action. On the other hand, momentum as a phenomenon is greatly overrated.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>You create your own successes, and if they follow one upon the other, it is your own doing. Belief in momentum will
    only make you emotional, less prone to act strategically, and more apt to repeat the same methods. Leave momentum
    for those who have nothing better to rely upon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Law 48 </p>
<p>Assume Formlessness </p>
<p>By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to
    grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The
    best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order.
    Everything changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reversal:</p>
<p>Using space to disperse and create an abstract pattern should not mean forsaking the concentration of your power when
    it is valuable to you. Formlessness makes your enemies hunt all over for you, scattering their own forces, mental as
    well as physical. When you finally engage them, though, hit them with a powerful, concentrated blow. That is how Mao
    succeeded against the Nationalists: He broke their forces into small, isolated units, which he then could easily
    overwhelm with a strong attack. The law of concentration prevailed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and keep your long term strategy in mind. When you
    assume a form and go on the attack, use concentration, speed, and power. As Mao said, “When we fight you, we make
    sure you can’t get away.”</p>
