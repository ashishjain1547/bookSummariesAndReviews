    Through her children, she has two sons in-law, Sir John Middleton and Mr. Palmer. Both of her daughters married
    exceedingly well, and their husbands are wealthy gentlemen.</br>
    </br>
    Mrs. Jennings was a bit of a meddler and took an active interest in the romantic lives of young people,
    especially
    Elinor and Marianne, much to their particular chagrin.</br>
    </br>
    -----------------------------</br>
    </br>

    </br>
    -----------------------------</br>
    </br>
    Henry Dashwood is a minor character in Sense and Sensibility. He was the head of the Dashwood family of Norland
    Park
    in Sussex[1]. Before his death, he was married to Mrs. Dashwood[2]. He had one son, John Dashwood, from a
    previous
    marriage. He had three daughters, Elinor Dashwood, Marianne Dashwood, and Margaret Dashwood from the current
    Mrs.
    Henry Dashwood. He cared for his second wife and daughters more than he cared for his son[1].</br>
    </br>
    "The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as
    pleasure. He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, to leave his estate from his nephew; but he left it to
    him on
    such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his
    wife
    and daughters than for himself or his son; but to his son, and his son's son, it was secured, in such a way, as
    to
    leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by
    any
    charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods."</br>
    —Sense and Sensibility[3]</br>
    </br>
    -----------------------------</br>
    </br>
    John Dashwood is a character in Sense and Sensibility. He is the only son and heir of Mr. Henry Dashwood and his
    first wife[1]. He is the stepson of Mrs. Henry Dashwood and the elder half-brother of Elinor Dashwood, Marianne
    Dashwood, and Margaret Dashwood. He is the brother-in-law of Edward Ferrars, Robert Ferrars, and Colonel
    Brandon. He
    is married to Frances Dashwood and has one son, Harry Dashwood.</br>
    </br>
    -----------------------------</br>
    </br>
    Frances "Fanny" Dashwood (née Ferrars) is the wife of John Dashwood. She is the only sister of Edward and Robert
    Ferrars. She is the sister-in-law of Elinor Dashwood, Marianne Dashwood, and Margaret Dashwood. She has one son,
    Harry Dashwood, whom she spoils. Her mother, Mrs. Ferrars is still living, although her father is not.</br>
    </br>
    -----------------------------</br>
    </br>
    Lady Middleton (née Jennings) is a minor character in Sense and Sensibility. She is married to Sir John
    Middleton of
    Barton Park, a very wealthy and generous man. She has four children and is around 26 or 27.</br>
    -----------------------------</br>
    </br>
    Sir John Middleton is a minor character in Sense and Sensibility. He is married to Lady Middleton, the daughter
    of
    Mrs. Jennings. He is wealthy and resides mostly at Barton Park, his family estate. He is about 40 at the
    beginning
    of the novel. He has four children, the eldest of which is a son of six years of age. The boy is also his
    heir.</br>
    </br>
    -----------------------------</br>
    </br>
    Mr. Palmer</br>
    Mr. Palmer is a rather serious man married to a rather silly young woman, and he's never quite recovered from
    this
    fact. We don't know much about Mr. Palmer, but what we do know paints a somewhat comical, contradictory picture.
    First of all, our first impressions of him are of a rude, sardonic, disinterested man, who seems to despise
    everyone
    else under the sun. However, as we get to know him a little better, we start to warm up to him.</br>
    </br>
    His muttered comments are often quite funny, and on the inside, it turns out that he's not such a boor. As
    Elinor
    notes late in the book, Mr. Palmer is actually just a man – he puts on his show of gruffness towards everyone
    else
    simply as a declaration of his gender. In reality, he shows a softer side once everyone's visiting his home at
    Cleveland; he's genuinely concerned about Marianne's illness, and he also reveals that he sincerely cares for
    his
    family.</br>
    </br>
    -----------------------------</br>
    </br>
    Mrs. Ferrars is a minor character in Sense and Sensibility. She is the mother of Fanny Dashwood, Edward Ferrars,
    and
    Robert Ferrars. She is the mother-in-law of John Dashwood, Elinor Dashwood Ferrars, and Lucy Steele. She has one
    grandchild, Harry Dashwood, so far.</br>
    </br>
    She is portrayed as a bad-tempered, unsympathetic woman who embodies all the foibles demonstrated in Fanny and
    Robert's characteristics. She is determined that her sons should marry well, even though the late Mr. Ferrars
    left
    them a fortune.</br>
    </br>
    -----------------------------</br>
    </br>
    Robert Ferrars is a character in Sense and Sensibility. By the end of the novel, he is married to Lucy Steele,
    the
    ex-fiancée of his elder brother Edward. He is the younger son of Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars, and brother of Edward
    Ferrars
    and Fanny Dashwood. He is brother-in-law to John Dashwood, Anne Steele, and Elinor Dashwood Ferrars.</br>

<h1>Plot</h1>
<div>
    Henry Dashwood, his second wife, and their three daughters live for many years with Henry's wealthy bachelor
    uncle
    at Norland Park, a large country estate in Sussex. That uncle decides, in late life, to will the use and income
    only
    of his property first to Henry, then to Henry's first son John Dashwood (by his first marriage), so that the
    property should pass intact to John's three-year-old son Harry. The uncle dies, but Henry lives just a year
    after
    that and he is unable in such short time to save enough money for his wife Mrs Dashwood, and their daughters,
    Elinor, Marianne and Margaret, who are left only a small income. On his deathbed, Mr Henry Dashwood extracts a
    promise from his son John to take care of his half-sisters. But before Henry is long in the grave, John's greedy
    wife, Fanny, persuades her husband to renege on the promise, appealing to his concerns about diminishing his own
    son
    Harry's inheritance despite the fact that John is independently wealthy thanks to his inheritance from his
    mother
    and his wife's dowry. Henry Dashwood's love for his second family is also used by Fanny to arouse her husband's
    jealousy and convince him not to help his sisters economically.</br>
    </br>
    John and Fanny immediately move in as the new owners of Norland, while the Dashwood women are treated as
    unwelcome
    guests by a spiteful Fanny. Mrs Dashwood seeks somewhere else to live. In the meantime, Fanny's brother, Edward
    Ferrars visits Norland and soon forms an attachment with Elinor. Fanny disapproves of the match and offends Mrs
    Dashwood by implying that Elinor must be motivated by his expectations of coming into money.</br>
    </br>
    Mrs Dashwood moves her family to Barton Cottage in Devonshire, near the home of her cousin, Sir John Middleton.
    Their new home is modest, but they are warmly received by Sir John and welcomed into local society, meeting his
    wife, Lady Middleton, his mother-in-law, the garrulous but well-meaning Mrs Jennings, and his friend, Colonel
    Brandon. Colonel Brandon is attracted to Marianne, and Mrs Jennings teases them about it. Marianne is not
    pleased,
    as she considers the thirty-five-year-old Colonel Brandon an old bachelor, incapable of falling in love or
    inspiring
    love in anyone.</br>
    </br>
    </br>
    A 19th-century illustration by Hugh Thomson showing Willoughby cutting a lock of Marianne's hair</br>
    While out for a walk, Marianne gets caught in the rain, slips, and sprains her ankle. The dashing John
    Willoughby
    sees the accident and assists her, picking her up and carrying her back to her home. After his rescue of her,
    Marianne quickly comes to admire his good looks and his similar tastes in poetry, music, art, and love. His
    attentions, and Marianne's behaviour, lead Elinor and Mrs Dashwood to suspect that the couple are secretly
    engaged.
    Elinor cautions Marianne against her unguarded conduct, but Marianne refuses to check her emotions. Willoughby
    engages in several intimate activities with Marianne, including taking her to see the home he expects to inherit
    one
    day and obtaining a lock of her hair. When an engagement, or at least the announcement of one, seems imminent,
    Mr
    Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his aunt, upon whom he is financially dependent, is sending him to London
    on
    business, indefinitely. Marianne is distraught and abandons herself to her sorrow.</br>
    </br>
    Edward Ferrars pays a short visit to Barton Cottage but seems unhappy. Elinor fears that he no longer has
    feelings
    for her, but she will not show her heartache. After Edward departs, the sisters Anne and Lucy Steele, who are
    vulgar
    cousins of Mrs. Jennings, come to stay at Barton Park. Lucy informs Elinor in confidence of her secret four-year
    engagement to Edward Ferrars that started when he was studying with her uncle, and she displays proof of their
    intimacy. Elinor realises that Lucy's visit and revelations are the result of Lucy's jealousy and cunning
    calculation, and it helps her to understand Edward's recent sadness and behaviour towards her. She acquits
    Edward of
    blame and pities him for being held to a loveless engagement to Lucy by his sense of honour.</br>
    </br>
    Elinor and Marianne accompany Mrs Jennings to London. On arriving, Marianne rashly writes several personal
    letters
    to Willoughby, which go unanswered. When they meet by chance at a dance, Willoughby is standing with another
    woman.
    He greets Marianne reluctantly and coldly, to her extreme distress. She shows him how shocked she is that he
    barely
    acknowledges her, and she leaves the party completely distraught. Soon Marianne receives a curt letter enclosing
    their former correspondence and love tokens, including a lock of her hair. Willoughby informs her of his
    engagement
    to a young lady, Miss Grey, who has a large fortune. Marianne is devastated. After Elinor has read the letter,
    Marianne admits to Elinor that she and Willoughby were never engaged. She behaved as if they were because she
    knew
    she loved him and thought that he loved her.</br>
    </br>
    As Marianne grieves, and Willoughby's engagement to Miss Grey is made public, Colonel Brandon visits the
    sisters. He
    reveals to Elinor that Willoughby is a scoundrel. His aunt disinherited him after she learned that he had
    seduced,
    impregnated, then abandoned Brandon's young ward, Miss Eliza Williams, and refused to marry her. Willoughby, in
    great personal debt, chose to marry Miss Grey for money rather than love. Eliza is the illegitimate daughter of
    Brandon's first love, also called Eliza, a young woman who was his father's ward and an heiress. She was forced
    into
    an unhappy marriage to Brandon's elder brother, in order to shore up the family's debts, and that marriage ended
    in
    scandal and divorce while Brandon was abroad with the Army. After Colonel Brandon's father and brother died, he
    inherited the family estate and returned to find Eliza dying in a pauper's home, so Brandon took charge of
    raising
    her young daughter. Brandon tells Elinor that Marianne strongly reminds him of the elder Eliza for her sincerity
    and
    sweet impulsiveness. Brandon removed the younger Eliza to the country, and reveals to Elinor all of these
    details in
    the hope that Marianne could get some consolation in discovering that Willoughby was revealed as a villain.</br>
    </br>
    Meanwhile, the Steele sisters have come to London as guests of Mrs Jennings. After a brief acquaintance, they
    are
    asked to stay at John and Fanny Dashwoods' London house. Lucy sees the invitation as a personal compliment,
    rather
    than what it is, a slight to Elinor and Marianne who, being family, should have received such invitation first.
    Too
    talkative, Anne Steele betrays Lucy's secret engagement to Edward Ferrars, Fanny's brother. As a result, the
    Misses
    Steele are turned out of the house, and Edward is ordered by his wealthy mother to break off the engagement on
    pain
    of disinheritance. Edward refuses to comply and is immediately disinherited in favour of his brother, Robert,
    which
    gains him respect for his conduct and sympathy from Elinor and Marianne. Colonel Brandon shows his admiration by
    offering Edward the living (a clergyman's income) of Delaford parsonage so that he might one day be able to
    afford
    to marry Lucy after he takes orders.</br>
    </br>
    As Marianne grieves over Willoughby, Mrs Jennings takes Elinor and Marianne to the country to visit her second
    daughter, Mrs. Charlotte Palmer, at her husband's estate, called Cleveland. Marianne, still in misery over
    Willoughby's marriage, goes walking in the rain and becomes dangerously ill. She is diagnosed with putrid fever,
    and
    it is believed that her life is in danger. Elinor writes to Mrs. Dashwood to explain the gravity of the
    situation,
    and Colonel Brandon volunteers to go and bring Marianne's mother to Cleveland to be with her. In the night,
    Willoughby arrives and reveals to Elinor that his love for Marianne was genuine and that losing her has made him
    miserable. He elicits Elinor's pity because his choice has made him unhappy, but she is disgusted by the callous
    way
    in which he talks of Miss Williams and his own wife. He also reveals that his aunt said she would have forgiven
    him
    if he married Miss Williams but that he refused.</br>
    </br>
    Marianne recovers from her illness, and Elinor tells her of Willoughby's visit. Marianne realises that she could
    never have been happy with Willoughby's immoral, erratic, and inconsiderate ways. She values Elinor's more
    moderated
    conduct with Edward and resolves to model herself after Elinor's courage and good sense. Edward arrives and
    reveals
    that, after his disinheritance, Lucy jilted him in favour of his now wealthy younger brother, Robert. Elinor is
    overjoyed. Edward and Elinor marry, and later Marianne marries Colonel Brandon, having gradually come to love
    him.
    The two couples live as neighbours, with both sisters and husbands in harmony with each other. Willoughby
    considers
    Marianne as his ideal but the narrator tells the reader not to suppose that he was never happy.

    “I am excessively fond of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I
    protest, if
    I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself, within a short distance of London,
    where
    I might drive myself down at any time, and collect a few friends about me and be happy. I advise everybody who
    is
    going to build, to build a cottage.” </br>
    </br>
    “But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by everybody at times, whatever be their
    education
    or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but patience; or give it a more fascinating name: call it
    hope.”
