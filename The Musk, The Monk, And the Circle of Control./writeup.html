So this is coming directly from my pen…
I've been reading a couple of books recently that have sparked some deep reflections on life, ambition, and presence. Among these books are <i>Elon Musk</i> by Walter Isaacson, <i>When Things Fall Apart</i> by Pema Chodron, and <i>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</i> by Stephen Covey. Each of these works offers unique insights into different ways of approaching life and the challenges it presents.

The reason I'm writing this post is to share my thoughts on how I digested the seemingly opposite and contradictory personalities of Elon Musk and a Buddhist monk. On one hand, we have Elon Musk, a visionary entrepreneur with boundless thoughts and ambitions. He's constantly thinking about "what's coming next," pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation. Musk is someone who thrives on challenges and disruption, perpetually in pursuit of a future that's bigger and brighter than the present.

On the other hand, there are Buddhist monks, as described by Pema Chodron, who focus on living in the present moment. They embrace the "here and now," finding peace and contentment in the simple act of being. For them, the journey inward is as significant as any outward achievement, if not more so. Their practice emphasizes mindfulness, acceptance, and letting go of the need to control everything around them.

These contrasting approaches to life got me thinking about Stephen Covey's concept of the "Circle of Control," which I find deeply relevant to both Musk's and the monk's philosophies. Covey's idea is that we should focus our energy on things within our control, rather than worrying about what's beyond our reach. This concept forms the foundation of personal effectiveness, enabling us to manage stress and maintain a sense of balance in our lives. 
[See the notes from Stephen Covey's book below]

Musk's relentless drive embodies a certain mastery over his Circle of Control. He leverages his skills, resources, and influence to effect change and create groundbreaking innovations. However, his approach can sometimes lead to stress and burnout, as it involves constant striving and little room for pause.

In contrast, the Buddhist monk operates from a place of acceptance and surrender. By focusing on what they can control—namely, their thoughts and reactions—they find peace amidst chaos. This doesn't mean they are passive; rather, they choose to engage with the world from a place of calm and clarity.

What I've realized through these readings is the importance of balancing these perspectives. We can learn from Musk's visionary thinking and relentless pursuit of goals, while also embracing the monk's practice of mindfulness and presence. By understanding and navigating our own Circle of Control, we can harness the best of both worlds—driving toward our dreams while remaining grounded in the present moment.

In conclusion, the key lies in finding harmony between ambition and mindfulness. By integrating the lessons from Elon Musk, Pema Chodron, and Stephen Covey, we can cultivate a life that's both fulfilling and centered. Let's embrace the challenges ahead with clarity and intention, as we navigate the dynamic dance between the future and the now.

<h3>Notes from Stephen Covey's book</h3>

<b>CIRCLE OF CONCERN/CIRCLE OF INFLUENCE</b>

Another excellent way to become more self-aware regarding our own degree of proactivity is to look at where we focus our time and energy. We each have a wide range of concerns---our health, our children, problems at work, the national debt, nuclear war. We could separate those from things in which we have no particular mental or emotional involvement by creating a "Circle of Concern."

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGPyqgMJbka4hOoTRfzpGOCs9XVXkikuBqfg3OvKYsHqsQ5xFzjwCkcGTb5B9pUmglZMwLy38trmmH5rhq1Cp_WrlyPnLeA_WDKmGT6ssEkHgiIfvqSeiRCGZxCYiRQ7P93khA-DUfPkKH_mQRw0nKwu_rDeH31gQBlleYgESlU60QS_6VBohwwgliFOLf/s502/circle%20of%20concern.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="600" data-original-height="484" data-original-width="502" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGPyqgMJbka4hOoTRfzpGOCs9XVXkikuBqfg3OvKYsHqsQ5xFzjwCkcGTb5B9pUmglZMwLy38trmmH5rhq1Cp_WrlyPnLeA_WDKmGT6ssEkHgiIfvqSeiRCGZxCYiRQ7P93khA-DUfPkKH_mQRw0nKwu_rDeH31gQBlleYgESlU60QS_6VBohwwgliFOLf/s600/circle%20of%20concern.png"/></a></div>

As we look at those things within our Circle of Concern, it becomes apparent that there are some things over which we have no real control and others that we can do something about. We could identify those concerns in the latter group by circumscribing them within a smaller Circle of Influence.

By determining which of these two circles is the focus of most of our time and energy, we can discover much about the degree of our proactivity.

Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about. The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and magnifying, causing their Circle of Influence to increase.

For both Elon Musk and Pema Chodron, there circle of concern and circle of influece is in proportion with each other.
