<p>Book Genre: Self-help, philosophy</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Blurb</b></p>
<p>Every human is a seeker of ‘Truth’. But almost all give up in the middle since they are threatened by their alter
    ego, ‘The Fallen One’. The first step is to accept that yes, ‘I’ am ‘The Fallen One’ and then proceed for soul
    searching. This is unstable equilibrium so the caution has to be practiced. So, I would like to reach ‘Youth of
    India’ in particular by presenting them what ‘search for self-realization’ has to offer. It is not easy, perhaps the
    most difficult task to be undertaken, but the persistence is the key. The book also contains few concepts related to
    science and mathematics which should interest logical minds. It is also meant for those who have gone under the same
    set of experience while performing soul search.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chapter 1 – The Fallen One</b></p>
<p>In this chapter the main focus is on the very entity responsible for challenging virtues in an individual. This is
    ‘something’ which is not separable for any of us. It is just a myth that we consider him to be something not part of
    us, it seduces us to commit evil. So we just guard ourselves from outer world but what about inner aspect which we
    just ignore. We believe that propagator of evil is ruler of Hell, which resides outside, so it does make sense to
    talk about concepts of Heaven and Hell. And how far they have penetrated our psychology? We are keen on finding
    answers what will happen after death but do we seriously try to change the way we live, something which can change
    the way we perceive and accept the end.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chapter 2 – The War: Dark and Light</b></p>
<p>What will an individual do when he is threatened? Most of us will become violent and try to justify our actions by
    calling it an act of self-defense. That’s the impact evil has on inner world of an individual, the noises in forms
    of evil thoughts which originates in his mind. But he does not realize that he is just fighting under their
    influence since light has nothing to do with any dispute. The seeker is forced to engage since he is not yet evolved
    as source of light but he should be selective in such battles else he will never experience a respite. The very
    break he needs to continue his journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chapter 3 – Faith Hurts</b></p>
<p>A stand has to be taken in the war. Either an individual will surrender to ‘The Fallen One’ or he will keep fighting.
    But sooner or later his resources will decline and he has to grab something to ensure continuation of the journey.
    That something is ‘Faith’. But getting attached to ‘Faith’ brings pains, sufferings and feeling of burning. The
    reason faith forbids engaging in any futile activity which may feed ‘The Fallen One’. Just imagine starving ‘The
    Fallen One’ who have been fed incessantly will react. He will grow aggressive will try to tear the new beliefs in
    pieces and that gives a feeling to an individual that faith hurts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chapter 4 – Who Am I?</b></p>
<p>Faith has its own way of awakening. Answers flow, doubts vaporize and sometimes events are of such magnitude happen
    that an individual may not have ever comprehended them. He would not have asked answers for few questions but still
    they are revealed. In fact, he would not have even asked such questions. So, answers to such questions may be
    discarded as mere illusion or myths of sleeping body but in reality they are indications that consciousness is
    gaining dynamism; then, the perception and outlook of the traveler changes. All the earlier believes begin to fall
    apart. A new human rises and the basic question about our origin begins to dissolve. An individual who always
    believed to have separate identity throughout his journey so far finds out that he is just an infinitesimal part of
    Infinite.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chapter 5 – Death: The Biggest Lie?</b></p>
<p>Matter, any physical form, has inevitable end. Why to ignore this fact, the basis of any life? Death is not being
    afraid of but it has to be respected since it will cease the opportunity form consciousness to continue further. But
    is it really the ‘Truth’? That is something which is revealed during the journey. No it is not since few destined
    one escaped it by becoming eternal. And then the ‘Death’ just appears as annihilation of physical form not of the
    consciousness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chapter 6 – The Selfless Warrior: Consciousness at The Highest Level</b></p>
<p>Individual have realized and accepted that Death is inevitable. But that is only by physical aspect. If the
    consciousness is raised to highest level the fear of death will just vanish. And right there a warrior is born. His
    agenda is not to raise war but to initiate the war against evil irrespective of fact whether it is found inside or
    outside. He does not make errors in selecting the war since he is the only one to recognize right and wrong. He does
    not carry out order from any living person, like in army a soldier has to respond to orders from his superior; He
    just listens to the will of ‘The One’. He is not seeker anymore but ‘A Transformation’ whom ‘Light’ has Himself
    designated as ‘His Own’.</p>
