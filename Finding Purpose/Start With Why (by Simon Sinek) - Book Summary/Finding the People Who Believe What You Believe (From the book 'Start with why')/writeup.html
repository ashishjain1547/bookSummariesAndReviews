<pre>
Early in the twentieth century, the English adventurer Ernest Shack- leton set out to explore the Antarctic. Roald Amundsen, a Norwe- gian, had only just become the first explorer ever to reach the South Pole, leaving one remaining conquest: the crossing of the continent via the southernmost tip of the earth.
The land part of the expedition would start at the frigid Weddell Sea, below South America, and travel 1,700 miles across the pole to the Ross Sea, below New Zealand. The cost, Shackleton estimated at the time, would be about $250,000. "The crossing of the south polar continent will be the biggest polar journey ever attempted,"
Shackleton told a reporter for the New York Times on December 29,
1913. "The unknown fields in the world which are still unconquered are narrowing down, but there still remains this great work."
On December 5, 1914, Shackleton and a crew of twenty-seven men set out for the Weddell Sea on the Endurance, a 350-ton ship that had been constructed with funds from private donors, the British government and the Royal Geographical Society. By then,
World War I was raging in Europe, and money was growing more scarce. Donations from English schoolchildren paid for the dog teams.
But the crew of the Endurance would never reach the continent of Antarctica.
Just a few days out of South Georgia Island in the southern Adantic, the ship encountered mile after mile of pack ice, and was soon trapped as winter moved in early and with fury. Ice closed in around the ship "like an almond in a piece of toffee," a crew member wrote. Shackleton and his crew were stranded in the Antarctic for ten months as the Endurance drifted slowly north, until the pressure of the ice floes finally crushed the ship. On November 21, 1915, the crew watched as she sank in the frigid waters of the Weddell Sea.
Stranded on the ice, the crew of the Endurance boarded their three lifeboats and landed on tiny Elephant Island. There Shackleton left behind all but five of his men and embarked on a hazardous journey across 800 miles of rough seas to find help. Which, eventu- ally, they did.
What makes the story of the Endurance so remarkable, however, is not the expedition, it's that throughout the whole ordeal no one died, There were no stories of people eating others and no mutiny.

This was not luck. This was because Shackleton hired good fits.
He found the right men for the job. When you fill an organization with good fits, those who believe what you believe, success just happens. And how did Shackleton find this amazing crew? With a simple ad in the London Times.
Compare that to how we hire people. Like Shackleton, we run ads in the newspaper, or on the modern equivalents, Craigslist or Monster.com. Sometimes we hire a recruiter to find someone for us, but the process is largely the same. We provide a list of qualifica- tions for the job and expect that the best candidate will be the one who meets those requirements.
The issue is how we write those ads. They are all about WHAT and not about WHY. A want ad might say, for example, "Account executive needed, minimum five years' experience, must have working knowledge of industry. Come work for a fantastic, fast- growing company with great pay and great benefits." The ad may produce loads of applicants, but how do we know which is the right fit? Shackleton's ad for crew members was different. His did not say WHAT he was looking for. His ad did not say: "Men needed for expedition. Minimum five years' experience.
Must know how to hoist mainsail. Come work for a fantastic captain."
Rather, Shackleton was looking for those with something more.
He was looking for a crew that belonged on such an expedition. His actual ad ran like this: "Men wanted for Hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success."
The only people who applied for the job were those who read the ad and thought it sounded great. They loved insurmountable odds. The only people who applied for the job were survivors. Shackleton hired only people who believed what he believed. Their ability to survive was guaranteed. When employees belong, they will guarantee your success. And they won't be working hard and looking for innovative solutions for you, they will be doing it for themselves.

What all great leaders have in common is the ability to find good fits to join their organizationsâ€”those who believe what they believe.
Southwest Airlines is a great example of a company with a knack for hiring good fits. Their ability to find people who embody their cause makes it much easier for them to provide great service. As Herb Kelleher famously said, "You don't hire for skills, you hire for attitude. You can always teach skills." This is all fine and good; the problem is, which attitude? What if their attitude is not one that fits your culture? I love asking companies whom they like to hire, and one of the most common answers I am given is, "We hire only passionate people." But how do you know if someone is passionate for inter- viewing, but not so passionate for working? The truth is, almost every person on the planet is passionate, we are just not all pas- sionate for the same things. Starting with WHY when hiring dra- matically increases your ability to attract those who are passionate for what you believe. Simply hiring people with a solid resume or great work ethic does not guarantee success. The best engineer at Apple, for example, would likely be miserable if he worked at Mi- crosoft. Likewise, the best engineer at Microsoft would probably not thrive at Apple. Both are highly experienced and work hard. Both may come highly recommended. However, each engineer does not fit the culture of the other's company. The goal is to hire those who are passionate for your WHY, your purpose, cause or belief, and who have the attitude that fits your culture. Once that is established, only then should their skill set and experience be evaluated.

Shackleton could have had the most experienced crew money could buy, but if they weren't able to connect on a level much deeper than their ability, their survival would not have been a foregone conclusion.

For years, Southwest didn't have a complaints departmentâ€” they didn't need one. Though Kelleher rightly talked about the need to hire for attitude, the airline in fact deserves more credit for hiring the good fits responsible for providing great service. Kelleher was not the only one making the hiring decisions, and asking everyone to simply trust their gut is too risky. Their genius came from figuring out why some people were such good fits and then devel- oping systems to find more of them.

In the 1970s, Southwest Airlines decided to put their flight at- tendants in hot pants and go-go boots as part of their uniforms (hey, it was the 1970s). It wasn't their idea; Pacific Southwest, the California-based airline after which Southwest modeled itself, did it first, Southwest simply copied them. Unlike Pacific Southwest, however, Southwest figured out something that would prove in- valuable. They realized that when they recruited flight attendants, the only people who applied for the job were cheerleaders and majorettes. That's because they were the only people who didn't mind wearing the new uniforms. Cheerleaders and majorettes, however, fit in perfectly at Southwest. They didn't just have a great attitude, their whole disposition was about cheering people on.

Spreading optimism. Leading crowds to believe that "we can win."

They were perfect fits at a company that was the champion of the common man. Realizing this, Southwest started to recruit only cheerleaders and majorettes.

Great companies don't hire skilled people and motivate them, they hire already motivated people and inspire them. People are either motivated or they are not. Unless you give motivated people something to believe in, something bigger than their job to work toward, they will motivate themselves to find a new job and you'll be stuck with whoever's left.
