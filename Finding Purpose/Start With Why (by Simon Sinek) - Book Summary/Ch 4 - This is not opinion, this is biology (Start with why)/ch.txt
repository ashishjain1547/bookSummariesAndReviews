In his 1961 story about the Sneetches, Dr. Seuss introduced us to
two groups of Sneetches, one with stars on their bellies and the
other with none. The ones without stars wanted desperately to get
stars so they could feel like they fit in. They were willing to go to
extreme lengths and pay larger and larger sums of money simply to
feel like they were part of a group. But only Sylvester McMonkey
McBean, the man whose machine puts "stars upon thars," profited
from the Sneetches' desire to fit in.
As with so many things, Dr. Seuss explained it best. The
Sneetches perfectly capture a very basic human need—the need to
belong. Our need to belong is not rational, but it is a constant that
exists across all people in all cultures. It is a feeling we get when
those around us share our values and beliefs. When we feel like we
belong we feel connected and we feel safe. As humans we crave the
feeling and we seek it out.
Sometimes our feeling of belonging is incidental. We're not
friends with everyone from our hometown, but travel across the
state, and you may meet someone from your hometown and you
instantly have a connection with them. We're not friends with ev-
eryone from our home state, but travel across the country, and
you'll feel a special bond with someone you meet who is from your
home state. Go abroad and you'll form instant bonds with other
Americans you meet. I remember a trip I took to Australia. One day
I was on a bus and heard an American accent. I turned and struck
up a conversation. I immediately felt connected to them, we could
speak the same language, understand the same slang. As a stranger
in a strange city, for that brief moment, I felt like I belonged, and
because of it, I trusted those strangers on the bus more than any
other passengers. In fact, we spent time together later. No matter
where we go, we trust those with whom we are able to perceive
common values or beliefs.
58THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY
Our desire to feel like we belong is so powerful that we will go to
great lengths, do irrational things and often spend money to get that
feeling. Like the Sneetches, we want to be around people and
organizations who are like us and share our beliefs. When
companies talk about WHAT they do and how advanced their
products are, they may have appeal, but they do not necessarily
represent something to which we want to belong. But when a
company clearly communicates their WHY, what they believe, and
we believe what they believe, then we will sometimes go to
extraordinary lengths to include those products or brands in our
lives. This is not because they are better, but because they become
markers or symbols of the values and beliefs we hold dear. Those
products and brands make us feel like we belong and we feel a
kinship with others who buy the same things. Fan clubs, started by
customers, are often formed without any help from the company
itself. These people form communities, in person or online, not just
to share their love of a product with others, but to be in the
company of people like them. Their decisions have nothing to do
with the company or its products; they have everything to do with
the individuals themselves.
Our natural need to belong also makes us good at spotting
things that don't belong. It's a sense we get. A feeling. Something
deep inside us, something we can't put into words, allows us to feel
how some things just fit and some things just don't. Dell selling mp3
players just doesn't feel right because Dell defines itself as a
computer company, so the only things that belong are computers.
Apple defines itself as a company on a mission and so anything
they do that fits that definition feels like it belongs. In 2004, they
produced a promotional iPod in partnership with the iconoclastic
Irish rock band U2. That makes sense. They would never have
produced a promotional iPod with Celine Dion, even though she's
sold vastly more records than U2 and may have a bigger audience.
59START WITH WHY
U2 and Apple belong together because they share the same values
and beliefs. They both push boundaries. It would not have made
sense if Apple released a special iPod with Celine Dion. As big as
her audience may be, the partnership just doesn't align.
Look no farther than Apple's TV commercials "I'm a Mac and I'm
a PC" for a perfect representation of who a Mac user needs to be to
feel like they belong. In the commercial, the Mac user is a young
guy, always in jeans and a T-shirt, always relaxed and always
having a sense of humor poking fun at "the system." The PC, as
defined by Apple, is in a suit. Older. Stodgy. To fit in with Mac, you
have to be like Mac. Microsoft responded to Apple with its own "I'm
a PC" campaign, which depicts people from all walks of life
identifying themselves as "PC." Microsoft included many more
people in their ads—teachers, scientists, musicians and children. As
one would expect from the company that supplies 95 percent of the
computer operating systems, to belong to that crowd, you have to
be everyone else. One is not better or worse; it depends on where
you feel like you belong. Are you a rabble-rouser or are you with
the majority?
We are drawn to leaders and organizations that are good at
communicating what they believe. Their ability to make us feel like
we belong, to make us feel special, safe and not alone is part of what
gives them the ability to inspire us. Those whom we consider great
leaders all have an ability to draw us close and to command our
loyalty. And we feel a strong bond with those who are also drawn
to the same leaders and organizations. Apple users feel a bond with
each other. Harley riders are bonded to each other. Anyone who
was drawn to hear Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. give his "I Have a
Dream" speech, regardless of race, religion or sex, stood together in
that crowd as brothers and sisters, bonded by their shared values
and beliefs. They knew they belonged together because they could
feel it in their gut.

Gut Decisions Don't Happen in Your Stomach
The principles of The Golden Circle are much more than a com-
munications hierarchy. Its principles are deeply grounded in the
evolution of human behavior. The power of WHY is not opinion, it's
biology. If you look at a cross section of the human brain, from the
top down, you see that the levels of The Golden Circle correspond
precisely with the three major levels of the brain.
The newest area of the brain, our Homo sapien brain, is the
neocortex, which corresponds with the WHAT level. The neocortex
is responsible for rational and analytical thought and language.
The middle two sections comprise the limbic brain. The limbic
brain is responsible for all of our feelings, such as trust and loyalty.
It is also responsible for all human behavior and all our decision-
making, but it has no capacity for language.
When we communicate from the outside in, when we commu-
nicate WHAT we do first, yes, people can understand vast amounts
of complicated information, like facts and features, but it does not
drive behavior. But when we communicate from the inside out,
we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls decision-
61START WITH WHY
making, and our language part of the brain allows us to rationalize
those decisions.
The part of the brain that controls our feelings has no capacity for
language. It is this disconnection that makes putting our feelings
into words so hard. We have trouble, for example, explaining why
we married the person we married. We struggle to put into words
the real reasons why we love them, so we talk around it or
rationalize it. "She's funny, she's smart," we start. But there are lots
of funny and smart people in the world, but we don't love them and
we don't want to marry them. There is obviously more to falling in
love than just personality and competence. Rationally, we know our
explanation isn't the real reason. It is how our loved ones make us
feel, but those feelings are really hard to put into words. So when
pushed, we start to talk around it. We may even say things that
don't make any rational sense. "She completes me," we might say,
for example. What does that mean and how do you look for
someone who does that so you can marry them? That's the problem
with love; we only know when we've found it because it "just feels
right."
The same is true for other decisions. When a decision feels right,
we have a hard time explaining why we did what we did. Again,
the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn't control
language, so we rationalize. This complicates the value of polls or
market research. Asking people why they chose you over another
may provide wonderful evidence of how they have rationalized the
decision, but it does not shed much light on the true motivation for
the decision. It's not that people don't know, it's that they have
trouble explaining why they do what they do. Decision-making and
the ability to explain those decisions exist in different parts of the
brain.
This is where "gut decisions" come from. They just feel right.
There is no part of the stomach that controls decision-making, it all
62THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY
happens in the limbic brain. It's not an accident that we use that
word "feel" to explain those decisions either. The reason gut deci-
sions feel right is because the part of the brain that controls them
also controls our feelings. Whether you defer to your gut or you're
simply following your heart, no matter which part of the body you
think is driving the decision, the reality is it's all in your limbic
brain.
Our limbic brain is powerful, powerful enough to drive behavior
that sometimes contradicts our rational and analytical under-
standing of a situation. We often trust our gut even if the decision
flies in the face of all the facts and figures. Richard Restak, a well-
known neuroscientist, talks about this in his book The Naked Brain.
When you force people to make decisions with only the rational
part of their brain, they almost invariably end up "overthinking."
These rational decisions tend to take longer to make, says Restak,
and can often be of lower quality. In contrast, decisions made with
the limbic brain, gut decisions, tend to be faster, higher-quality
decisions. This is one of the primary reasons why teachers tell stu-
dents to go with their first instinct when taking a multiple-choice
test, to trust their gut. The more time spent thinking about the
answer, the bigger the risk that it may be the wrong one. Our
limbic brains are smart and often know the right thing to do. It is
our inability to verbalize the reasons that may cause us to doubt
ourselves or trust the empirical evidence when our gut tells us not
to.
Consider the experience of buying a flat-screen TV at your local
electronics store. You stand in the aisle listening to an expert explain
to you the difference between LCD and plasma. The sales rep gives
you all the rational differences and benefits, yet you are still none
the wiser as to which one is best for you. After an hour, you still
have no clue. Your mind is on overload because you're over-
thinking the decision. You eventually make a choice and walk out of
63START WITH WHY
the store, still not 100 percent convinced you chose the right one.
Then you go to your friend's house and see that he bought the
"other one." He goes on and on about how much he loves his TV.
Suddenly you're jealous, even though you still don't know that his
is any better than yours. You wonder, "Did I buy the wrong one?"
Companies that fail to communicate a sense of WHY force us to
make decisions with only empirical evidence. This is why those de-
cisions take more time, feel difficult or leave us uncertain. Under
these conditions manipulative strategies that exploit our desires,
fears, doubts or fantasies work very well. We're forced to make
these less-than-inspiring decisions for one simple reason—
companies don't offer us anything else besides the facts and figures,
features and benefits upon which to base our decisions. Companies
don't tell us WHY.
People don't buy WHAT you do; they buy WHY you do it. A
failure to communicate WHY creates nothing but stress or doubt. In
contrast, many people who are drawn to buy Macintosh computers
or Harley-Davidson motorcycles, for example, don't need to talk to
anyone about which brand to choose. They feel the utmost
confidence in their decision and the only question they ask is which
Mac or which Harley. At that level, the rational features and bene-
fits, facts and figures absolutely matter, but not to drive the decision
to give money or loyalty to the company or brand. That decision is
already made. The tangible features are simply to help direct the
choice of product that best fits our needs. In these cases, the deci-
sions happened in the perfect inside-out order. Those decisions
started with WHY—the emotional component of the decision— and
then the rational components allowed the buyer to verbalize or
rationalize the reasons for their decision.
This is what we mean when we talk about winning hearts and
minds. The heart represents the limbic, feeling part of the brain, and
the mind is the rational, language center. Most companies are quite
64THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY
adept at winning minds; all that requires is a comparison of all the
features and benefits. Winning hearts, however, takes more work.
Given the evidence of the natural order of decision-making, I can't
help but wonder if the order of the expression "hearts and minds" is
a coincidence. Why does no one set out to win "minds and hearts"?
The ability to win hearts before minds is not easy. It's a delicate
balance of art and science—another coincidental grammatical
construction. Why is it that things are not a balance of science and
art, but always art before science? Perhaps it is a subtle clue our
language-impaired limbic brain is sending us to help us see that the
art of leading is about following your heart. Perhaps our brains are
trying to tell us that WHY must come first.
Absent a WHY, a decision is harder to make. And when in doubt
we look to science, to data, to guide decisions. Companies will tell
you that the reason they start with WHAT they do or HOW they do
it is because that's what their customers asked for. Quality. Service.
Price. Features. That's what the data reported. But for the fact that
the part of the brain that controls decision-making is different from
the part of the brain that is able to report back that decision, it
would be a perfectly valid conclusion to give people what they ask
for. Unfortunately, there is more evidence that sales don't sig-
nificantly increase and bonds of loyalty are not formed simply when
companies say or do everything their customers want. Henry Ford
summed it up best. "If I had asked people what they wanted," he
said, "they would have said a faster horse."
This is the genius of great leadership. Great leaders and great
organizations are good at seeing what most of us can't see. They are
good at giving us things we would never think of asking for. When
the computer revolution was afoot, computer users couldn't ask for
a graphical user interface. But that's what Apple gave us. In the face
of expanding competition in the airline industry, most air travelers
would never have thought to ask for less instead of more. But that's
65START WITH WHY
what Southwest did. And in the face of hard times and
overwhelming odds, few would have asked their country, what can
I do for you over what can you do for me? The very cause upon
which John F. Kennedy introduced his presidency. Great leaders are
those who trust their gut. They are those who understand the art
before the science. They win hearts before minds. They are the ones
who start with WHY.
We make decisions all day long, and many of them are emotion-
ally driven. Rarely do we sift through all the available information
to ensure we know every fact. And we don't need to. It is all about
degrees of certainty. "I can make a decision with 30 percent of the
information," said former secretary of state Colin Powell. "Anything
more than 80 percent is too much." There is always a level at which
we trust ourselves or those around us to guide us, and don't always
feel we need all the facts and figures. And sometimes we just may
not trust ourselves to make a certain decision yet. This may explain
why we feel (there's that word again) so uncomfortable when others
twist our arm to make a decision that doesn't sit well in our gut. We
trust our gut to help us decide whom to vote for or which shampoo
to buy. Because our biology complicates our ability to verbalize the
real reasons why we make the decisions we do, we rationalize based
on more tangible factors, like the design or the service or the brand.
This is the basis for the false assumption that price or features mat-
ter more than they do. Those things matter, they provide us the
tangible things we can point to to rationalize our decision-making,
but they don't set the course and they don't inspire behavior.
It's What You Can't See That Matters
"Gets your whites whiter and your brights brighter," said the TV
commercial for the newest laundry detergent. This was the value
proposition for so many years in the laundry detergent business. A
perfectly legitimate claim. That's what the market research revealed
66THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY
customers wanted. The data was true, but the truth of what people
wanted was different.
The makers of laundry detergent asked consumers WHAT they
wanted from detergent, and consumers said whiter whites and
brighter brights. Not such a remarkable finding, if you think about
it, that people doing laundry wanted their detergent to help get their
clothes not just clean, but very clean. So brands attempted to dif-
ferentiate HOW they got your whites whiter and brights brighter by
trying to convince consumers that one additive was more effective
than another. Protein, said one brand. Color enhancers, said another.
No one asked customers WHY they wanted their clothes clean. That
little nugget wasn't revealed until many years later when a group of
anthropologists hired by one of the packaged-goods companies
revealed that all those additives weren't in fact driving behavior.
They observed that when people took their washing out of the
dryer, no one held it up to the light to see how white it was or
compared it to newer items to see how bright it was. The first thing
people did when they pulled their laundry out of the dryer was to
smell it. This was an amazing discovery. Feeling clean was more im-
portant to people than being clean. There was a presumption that all
detergents get your clothes clean. That's what detergent is supposed
to do. But having their clothes smell fresh and clean mattered much
more than the nuanced differences between which detergent
actually made clothes measurably cleaner.
That a false assumption swayed an entire industry to follow the
wrong direction is not unique to detergents. Cell phone companies
believed people wanted more options and buttons until Apple in-
troduced its iPhone with fewer options and only one button. The
German automakers believed their engineering alone mattered to
American car buyers. They were stunned and perplexed when they
learned that great engineering wasn't enough. One by one, the
German luxury car makers begrudgingly added cup holders to their
67START WITH WHY
fine automobiles. It was a feature that mattered a great deal to
commuter-minded Americans, but was rarely mentioned in any
research about what factors influenced purchase decisions. I am not,
for a moment, proposing that cup holders make people loyal to
BMWs. All I am proposing is that even for rationally minded car
buyers, there is more to decision-making than meets the eye.
Literally.
The power of the limbic brain is astounding. It not only controls
our gut decisions, but it can influence us to do things that seem
illogical or irrational. Leaving the safety of home to explore faraway
places. Crossing oceans to see what's on the other side. Leaving a
stable job to start a business out of your basement with no money in
the bank. Many of us look at these decisions and say, "That's stupid,
you're crazy. You could lose everything. You could get yourself
killed. What are you thinking?" It is not logic or facts but our hopes
and dreams, our hearts and our guts, that drive us to try new things.
If we were all rational, there would be no small businesses, there
would be no exploration, there would be very little innovation and
there would be no great leaders to inspire all those things. It is the
undying belief in something bigger and better that drives that kind
of behavior. But it can also control behavior born out of other
emotions, like hate or fear. Why else would someone plot to hurt
someone they had never met?
The amount of market research that reveals that people want to
do business with the company that offers them the best-quality
products, with the most features, the best service and all at a good
price is astounding. But consider the companies with the greatest
loyalty—they rarely have all those things. If you wanted to buy a
custom Harley-Davidson, you used to wait six months for delivery
(to give them credit, they've got it down from a year). That's bad
service! Apple's computers are at least 25 percent more expensive
than a comparable PC. There is less software available for their
68THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY
operating system. They have fewer peripherals. The machines them-
selves are sometimes slower than a comparable PC. If people made
only rational decisions, and did all the research before making a
purchase, no one would ever buy a Mac. But of course people do
buy Macs. And some don't just buy them—they love them, a feeling
that comes straight from the heart. Or the limbic brain.
We all know someone who is a die-hard Mac lover. Ask them
WHY they love their Mac. They won't tell you, "Well, I see myself as
someone who likes to challenge the status quo, and it's important
for me to surround myself with the people, products and brands
that prove to the outside world who I believe I am." Biologically,
that's what happened. But that decision was made in the part of the
brain that controls behavior but not language. So they will provide a
rationalization: "It's the user interface. It's the simplicity. It's the
design. It's the high quality. They're the best computers. I'm a
creative person." In reality, their purchase decision and their loyalty
are deeply personal. They don't really care about Apple; it's all
about them.
The same can even be said for the people who love to work at
Apple. Even employees can't put it into words. In their case, their
job is one of the WHATs to their WHY. They too are convinced it's
the quality of the products alone that is behind Apple's success. But
deep inside, they all love being a part of something bigger than
themselves. The most loyal Apple employees, like the most loyal
Apple customers, all love a good revolution. A great raise and
added benefits couldn't convince a loyal Apple employee to work
for Dell, and no amount of cash-back incentives and rebates could
convince a loyal Mac user to switch to a PC (many are already
paying double the price). This is beyond rational. This is a belief. It's
no accident that the culture at Apple is often described as a cult. It's
more than just products, it's a cause to support. It's a matter of faith.
69START WITH WHY
Remember the Honda and the Ferrari? Products are not just
symbols of what the company believes, they also serve as symbols
of what the loyal buyers believe. People with Apple laptop com-
puters, for example, love opening them up while sitting in an air-
port. They like that everyone knows they are using a Mac. It's an
emblem, a symbol of who they are. That glowing Apple logo speaks
to something about them and how they see the world. Does anyone
notice when someone pops open the lid of their HP or Dell
computer? No! Not even the people using the computers care. HP
and Dell have a fuzzy sense of WHY, so their products and their
brands don't symbolize anything about the users. To the Dell or HP
user, their computer, no matter how fast or sleek, is not a symbol of
a higher purpose, cause or belief. It's just a computer. In fact, for the
longest time, the logo on the lid of a Dell computer faced the user so
when they opened it, it would be upside down for everyone else.
Products with a clear sense of WHY give people a way to tell the
outside world who they are and what they believe. Remember,
people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. If a
company does not have a clear sense of WHY then it is impossible
for the outside world to perceive anything more than WHAT the
company does. And when that happens, manipulations that rely on
pushing price, features, service or quality become the primary cur-
rency of differentiation.
