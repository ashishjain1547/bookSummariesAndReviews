<pre><h1>What does trauma does to you?</h1>
<h2>1. TRAUMA AND THE LOSS OF SELF</h2>

The first study I did at the VA started with systematically asking veterans
what had happened to them in Vietnam. I wanted to know what had pushed
them over the brink, and why some had broken down as a result of that
experience while others had been able to go on with their lives.3 Most of the
men I interviewed had gone to war feeling well prepared, drawn close by
the rigors of basic training and the shared danger. They exchanged pictures
of their families and girlfriends; they put up with one another’s flaws. And
they were prepared to risk their lives for their friends. Most of them
confided their dark secrets to a buddy, and some went so far as to share each
other’s shirts and socks.

Many of the men had friendships similar to Tom’s with Alex. Tom met
Alex, an Italian guy from Malden, Massachusetts, on his first day in
country, and they instantly became close friends. They drove their jeep
together, listened to the same music, and read each other’s letters from
home. They got drunk together and chased the same Vietnamese bar girls.
After about three months in country Tom led his squad on a foot patrol
through a rice paddy just before sunset. Suddenly a hail of gunfire spurted
from the green wall of the surrounding jungle, hitting the men around him
one by one. Tom told me how he had looked on in helpless horror as all the
members of his platoon were killed or wounded in a matter of seconds. He
would never get one image out of his mind: the back of Alex’s head as he
lay facedown in the rice paddy, his feet in the air. Tom wept as he recalled,
“He was the only real friend I ever had.” Afterward, at night, Tom
continued to hear the screams of his men and to see their bodies falling into
the water. Any sounds, smells, or images that reminded him of the ambush
(like the popping of firecrackers on the Fourth of July) made him feel just
as paralyzed, terrified, and enraged as he had the day the helicopter
evacuated him from the rice paddy.

Maybe even worse for Tom than the recurrent flashbacks of the ambush
was the memory of what happened afterward. I could easily imagine how
Tom’s rage about his friend’s death had led to the calamity that followed. It
took him months of dealing with his paralyzing shame before he could tell
me about it. Since time immemorial veterans, like Achilles in Homer’s
Iliad, have responded to the death of their comrades with unspeakable acts
of revenge. The day after the ambush Tom went into a frenzy to a
neighboring village, killing children, shooting an innocent farmer, and
raping a Vietnamese woman. After that it became truly impossible for him
to go home again in any meaningful way. How can you face your
sweetheart and tell her that you brutally raped a woman just like her, or
watch your son take his first step when you are reminded of the child you
murdered? Tom experienced the death of Alex as if part of himself had been
forever destroyed—the part that was good and honorable and trustworthy.
Trauma, whether it is the result of something done to you or something you
yourself have done, almost always makes it difficult to engage in intimate
relationships. After you have experienced something so unspeakable, how
do you learn to trust yourself or anyone else again? Or, conversely, how can
you surrender to an intimate relationship after you have been brutally
violated?
Tom kept showing up faithfully for his appointments, as I had become
for him a lifeline—the father he’d never had, an Alex who had survived the
ambush. It takes enormous trust and courage to allow yourself to remember.
One of the hardest things for traumatized people is to confront their shame
about the way they behaved during a traumatic episode, whether it is
objectively warranted (as in the commission of atrocities) or not (as in the
case of a child who tries to placate her abuser). One of the first people to
write about this phenomenon was Sarah Haley, who occupied an office next
to mine at the VA Clinic. In an article entitled “When the Patient Reports
Atrocities,”4 which became a major impetus for the ultimate creation of the
PTSD diagnosis, she discussed the well-nigh intolerable difficulty of talking
about (and listening to) the horrendous acts that are often committed by
soldiers in the course of their war experiences. It’s hard enough to face the
suffering that has been inflicted by others, but deep down many traumatized
people are even more haunted by the shame they feel about what they
themselves did or did not do under the circumstances. They despise
themselves for how terrified, dependent, excited, or enraged they felt.
In later years I encountered a similar phenomenon in victims of child
abuse: Most of them suffer from agonizing shame about the actions they
took to survive and maintain a connection with the person who abused
them. This was particularly true if the abuser was someone close to the
child, someone the child depended on, as is so often the case. The result can
be confusion about whether one was a victim or a willing participant, which
in turn leads to bewilderment about the difference between love and terror;
pain and pleasure. We will return to this dilemma throughout this book.

<h2>2. NUMBING</h2>

Maybe the worst of Tom’s symptoms was that he felt emotionally numb. He
desperately wanted to love his family, but he just couldn’t evoke any deep
feelings for them. He felt emotionally distant from everybody, as though his
heart were frozen and he were living behind a glass wall. That numbness
extended to himself, as well. He could not really feel anything except for
his momentary rages and his shame. He described how he hardly
recognized himself when he looked in the mirror to shave. When he heard
himself arguing a case in court, he would observe himself from a distance
and wonder how this guy, who happened to look and talk like him, was able
to make such cogent arguments. When he won a case he pretended to be
gratified, and when he lost it was as though he had seen it coming and was
resigned to the defeat even before it happened. Despite the fact that he was
a very effective lawyer, he always felt as though he were floating in space,
lacking any sense of purpose or direction.
The only thing that occasionally relieved this feeling of aimlessness
was intense involvement in a particular case. During the course of our
treatment Tom had to defend a mobster on a murder charge. For the
duration of that trial he was totally absorbed in devising a strategy for
winning the case, and there were many occasions on which he stayed up all
night to immerse himself in something that actually excited him. It was like
being in combat, he said—he felt fully alive, and nothing else mattered. The
moment Tom won that case, however, he lost his energy and sense of
purpose. The nightmares returned, as did his rage attacks—so intensely that
he had to move into a motel to ensure that he would not harm his wife or
children. But being alone, too, was terrifying, because the demons of the
war returned in full force. Tom tried to stay busy, working, drinking, and
drugging—doing anything to avoid confronting his demons.
He kept thumbing through Soldier of Fortune, fantasizing about
enlisting as a mercenary in one of the many regional wars then raging in
Africa. That spring he took out his Harley and roared up the Kancamagus
Highway in New Hampshire. The vibrations, speed, and danger of that ride
helped him pull himself back together, to the point that he was able to leave
his motel room and return to his family.

<h2>3. THE REORGANIZATION OF PERCEPTION
...And The Rorschach Test </h2>

Another study I conducted at the VA started out as research about
nightmares but ended up exploring how trauma changes people’s
perceptions and imagination. Bill, a former medic who had seen heavy
action in Vietnam a decade earlier, was the first person enrolled in my
nightmare study. After his discharge he had enrolled in a theological
seminary and had been assigned to his first parish in a Congregational
church in a Boston suburb. He was doing fine until he and his wife had their
first child. Soon after the baby’s birth, his wife, a nurse, had gone back to
work while he remained at home, working on his weekly sermon and other
parish duties and taking care of their newborn. On the very first day he was
left alone with the baby, it began to cry, and he found himself suddenly
flooded with unbearable images of dying children in Vietnam.
Bill had to call his wife to take over child care and came to the VA in a
panic. He described how he kept hearing the sounds of babies crying and
seeing images of burned and bloody children’s faces. My medical
colleagues thought that he must surely be psychotic, because the textbooks
of the time said that auditory and visual hallucinations were symptoms of
paranoid schizophrenia. The same texts that provided this diagnosis also
supplied a cause: Bill’s psychosis was probably triggered by his feeling
displaced in his wife’s affections by their new baby.
As I arrived at the intake office that day, I saw Bill surrounded by
worried doctors who were preparing to inject him with a powerful
antipsychotic drug and ship him off to a locked ward. They described his
symptoms and asked my opinion. Having worked in a previous job on a
ward specializing in the treatment of schizophrenics, I was intrigued.
Something about the diagnosis didn’t sound right. I asked Bill if I could talk
with him, and after hearing his story, I unwittingly paraphrased something
Sigmund Freud had said about trauma in 1895: “I think this man is
suffering from memories.” I told Bill that I would try to help him and, after
offering him some medications to control his panic, asked if he would be
willing to come back a few days later to participate in my nightmare study.5
He agreed.
As part of that study we gave our participants a Rorschach test.6 Unlike
tests that require answers to straightforward questions, responses to the
Rorschach are almost impossible to fake. The Rorschach provides us with a
unique way to observe how people construct a mental image from what is
basically a meaningless stimulus: a blot of ink. Because humans are
meaning-making creatures, we have a tendency to create some sort of
image or story out of those inkblots, just as we do when we lie in a meadow
on a beautiful summer day and see images in the clouds floating high
above. What people make out of these blots can tell us a lot about how their
minds work.
On seeing the second card of the Rorschach test, Bill exclaimed in
horror, “This is that child that I saw being blown up in Vietnam. In the
middle, you see the charred flesh, the wounds, and the blood is spurting out
all over.” Panting and with sweat beading on his forehead, he was in a panic
similar to the one that had initially brought him to the VA clinic. Although I
had heard veterans describing their flashbacks, this was the first time I
actually witnessed one. In that very moment in my office, Bill was
obviously seeing the same images, smelling the same smells, and feeling
the same physical sensations he had felt during the original event. Ten years
after helplessly holding a dying baby in his arms, Bill was reliving the
trauma in response to an inkblot.
Experiencing Bill’s flashback firsthand in my office helped me realize
the agony that regularly visited the veterans I was trying to treat and helped
me appreciate again how critical it was to find a solution. The traumatic
event itself, however horrendous, had a beginning, a middle, and an end,
but I now saw that flashbacks could be even worse. You never know when
you will be assaulted by them again and you have no way of telling when
they will stop. It took me years to learn how to effectively treat flashbacks,
and in this process Bill turned out to be one of my most important mentors.
When we gave the Rorschach test to twenty-one additional veterans,
the response was consistent: Sixteen of them, on seeing the second card,
reacted as if they were experiencing a wartime trauma. The second
Rorschach card is the first card that contains color and often elicits socalled
color shock in response. The veterans interpreted this card with
descriptions like “These are the bowels of my friend Jim after a mortar shell
ripped him open” and “This is the neck of my friend Danny after his head
was blown off by a shell while we were eating lunch.” None of them
mentioned dancing monks, fluttering butterflies, men on motorcycles, or
any of the other ordinary, sometimes whimsical images that most people
see.
While the majority of the veterans were greatly upset by what they saw,
the reactions of the remaining five were even more alarming: They simply
went blank. “This is nothing,” one observed, “just a bunch of ink.” They
were right, of course, but the normal human response to ambiguous stimuli
is to use our imagination to read something into them.
We learned from these Rorschach tests that traumatized people have a
tendency to superimpose their trauma on everything around them and have
trouble deciphering whatever is going on around them. There appeared to
be little in between. We also learned that trauma affects the imagination.
The five men who saw nothing in the blots had lost the capacity to let their
minds play. But so, too, had the other sixteen men, for in viewing scenes
from the past in those blots they were not displaying the mental flexibility
that is the hallmark of imagination. They simply kept replaying an old reel.
Imagination is absolutely critical to the quality of our lives. Our
imagination enables us to leave our routine everyday existence by
fantasizing about travel, food, sex, falling in love, or having the last word—
all the things that make life interesting. Imagination gives us the
opportunity to envision new possibilities—it is an essential launchpad for
making our hopes come true. It fires our creativity, relieves our boredom,
alleviates our pain, enhances our pleasure, and enriches our most intimate
relationships. When people are compulsively and constantly pulled back
into the past, to the last time they felt intense involvement and deep
emotions, they suffer from a failure of imagination, a loss of the mental
flexibility. Without imagination there is no hope, no chance to envision a
better future, no place to go, no goal to reach.
The Rorschach tests also taught us that traumatized people look at the
world in a fundamentally different way from other people. For most of us a
man coming down the street is just someone taking a walk. A rape victim,
however, may see a person who is about to molest her and go into a panic.
A stern schoolteacher may be an intimidating presence to an average kid,
but for a child whose stepfather beats him up, she may represent a torturer
and precipitate a rage attack or a terrified cowering in the corner.

<h2>A NEW UNDERSTANDING</h2>

In the three decades since I met Tom, we have learned an enormous amount
not only about the impact and manifestations of trauma but also about ways
to help traumatized people find their way back. Since the early 1990s brainimaging
tools have started to show us what actually happens inside the
brains of traumatized people. This has proven essential to understanding the
damage inflicted by trauma and has guided us to formulate entirely new
avenues of repair.
We have also begun to understand how overwhelming experiences
affect our innermost sensations and our relationship to our physical reality
—the core of who we are. We have learned that trauma is not just an event
that took place sometime in the past; it is also the imprint left by that
experience on mind, brain, and body. This imprint has ongoing
consequences for how the human organism manages to survive in the present.

Trauma results in a fundamental reorganization of the way mind and
brain manage perceptions. It changes not only how we think and what we
think about, but also our very capacity to think. We have discovered that
helping victims of trauma find the words to describe what has happened to
them is profoundly meaningful, but usually it is not enough. The act of
telling the story doesn’t necessarily alter the automatic physical and
hormonal responses of bodies that remain hypervigilant, prepared to be
assaulted or violated at any time. For real change to take place, the body
needs to learn that the danger has passed and to live in the reality of the
present. Our search to understand trauma has led us to think differently not
only about the structure of the mind but also about the processes by which it
heals. </pre>
