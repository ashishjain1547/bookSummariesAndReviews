<h1>PART TWO
THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON TRAUMA</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER 4
RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE: THE ANATOMY OF SURVIVAL</h2>

On September 11, 2001, five-year-old Noam Saul witnessed the first
passenger plane slam into the World Trade Center from the windows
of his first-grade classroom at PS 234, less than 1,500 feet away. He and his
classmates ran with their teacher down the stairs to the lobby, where most
of them were reunited with parents who had dropped them off at school just
moments earlier. Noam, his older brother, and their dad were three of the
tens of thousands of people who ran for their lives through the rubble, ash,
and smoke of lower Manhattan that morning.
Ten days later I visited his family, who are friends of mine, and that
evening his parents and I went for a walk in the eerie darkness through the
still-smoking pit where Tower One once stood, making our way among the
rescue crews who were working around the clock under the blazing klieg
lights. When we returned home, Noam was still awake, and he showed me a
picture that he had drawn at 9:00 a.m. on September 12. The drawing
depicted what he had seen the day before: an airplane slamming into the
tower, a ball of fire, firefighters, and people jumping from the tower’s
windows. But at the bottom of the picture he had drawn something else: a
black circle at the foot of the buildings. I had no idea what it was, so I asked
him. “A trampoline,” he replied. What was a trampoline doing there? Noam
explained, “So that the next time when people have to jump they will be
safe.” I was stunned: This five-year-old boy, a witness to unspeakable
mayhem and disaster just twenty-four hours before he made that drawing,
had used his imagination to process what he had seen and begin to go on
with his life.
Noam was fortunate. His entire family was unharmed, he had grown up
surrounded by love, and he was able to grasp that the tragedy they had
witnessed had come to an end. During disasters young children usually take
their cues from their parents. As long as their caregivers remain calm and
responsive to their needs, they often survive terrible incidents without
serious psychological scars.

<i>Five-year-old Noam’s drawing made after he witnessed the World Trade Center attack on 9/11. He reproduced the image that haunted so many survivors—people jumping to escape from the inferno—but with a life-saving addition: a trampoline at the bottom of the collapsing building.</i>


But Noam’s experience allows us to see in outline two critical aspects
of the adaptive response to threat that is basic to human survival. At the
time the disaster occurred, he was able to take an active role by running
away from it, thus becoming an agent in his own rescue. And once he had
reached the safety of home, the alarm bells in his brain and body quieted.
This freed his mind to make some sense of what had happened and even to
imagine a creative alternative to what he had seen—a lifesaving trampoline.
In contrast to Noam, traumatized people become stuck, stopped in their
growth because they can’t integrate new experiences into their lives. I was
very moved when the veterans of Patton’s army gave me a World War II
army-issue watch for Christmas, but it was a sad memento of the year their
lives had effectively stopped: 1944. Being traumatized means continuing to
organize your life as if the trauma were still going on—unchanged and
immutable—as every new encounter or event is contaminated by the past.


<i>Trauma affects the entire human organism—body, mind, and brain. In PTSD the body
continues to defend against a threat that belongs to the past. Healing from PTSD means being
able to terminate this continued stress mobilization and restoring the entire organism to safety.</i>


After trauma the world is experienced with a different nervous system.
The survivor’s energy now becomes focused on suppressing inner chaos, at
the expense of spontaneous involvement in their lives. These attempts to
maintain control over unbearable physiological reactions can result in a
whole range of physical symptoms, including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue,
and other autoimmune diseases. This explains why it is critical for trauma
treatment to engage the entire organism, body, mind, and brain.

<h2>ORGANIZED TO SURVIVE</h2>

This illustration above shows the whole-body response to threat.
When the brain’s alarm system is turned on, it automatically triggers
preprogrammed physical escape plans in the oldest parts of the brain. As in
other animals, the nerves and chemicals that make up our basic brain
structure have a direct connection with our body. When the old brain takes
over, it partially shuts down the higher brain, our conscious mind, and
propels the body to run, hide, fight, or, on occasion, freeze. By the time we
are fully aware of our situation, our body may already be on the move. If
the fight/flight/freeze response is successful and we escape the danger, we
recover our internal equilibrium and gradually “regain our senses.”

<b>Effective action versus immobilization. </b>

Effective action (the result of fight/flight) ends the
threat. Immobilization keeps the body in a state of inescapable shock and learned helplessness.
Faced with danger people automatically secrete stress hormones to fuel resistance and escape.
Brain and body are programmed to run for home, where safety can be restored and stress
hormones can come to rest. In these strapped-down men who are being evacuated far from
home after Hurricane Katrina stress hormone levels remain elevated and are turned against the
survivors, stimulating ongoing fear, depression, rage, and physical disease.

If for some reason the normal response is blocked—for example, when
people are held down, trapped, or otherwise prevented from taking effective
action, be it in a war zone, a car accident, domestic violence, or a rape—the
brain keeps secreting stress chemicals, and the brain’s electrical circuits
continue to fire in vain.2 Long after the actual event has passed, the brain
may keep sending signals to the body to escape a threat that no longer
exists. Since at least 1889, when the French psychologist Pierre Janet
published the first scientific account of traumatic stress,3 it has been
recognized that trauma survivors are prone to “continue the action, or rather
the (futile) attempt at action, which began when the thing happened.” Being
able to move and do something to protect oneself is a critical factor in
determining whether or not a horrible experience will leave long-lasting
scars.

<h2>THE BRAIN FROM BOTTOM TO TOP</h2>

The most important job of the brain is to ensure our survival, even under the
most miserable conditions. Everything else is secondary. In order to do that,
brains need to: 
(1) generate internal signals that register what our bodies need, such as food, rest, protection, sex, and shelter; 

(2) create a map of the world to point us where to go to satisfy those needs; 

(3) generate the necessary energy and actions to get us there; 

(4) warn us of dangers and opportunities along the way; and 

(5) adjust our actions based on the requirements of the moment.

And since we human beings are mammals,
creatures that can only survive and thrive in groups, all of these imperatives
require coordination and collaboration. Psychological problems occur when
our internal signals don’t work, when our maps don’t lead us where we
need to go, when we are too paralyzed to move, when our actions do not
correspond to our needs, or when our relationships break down. Every brain
structure that I discuss has a role to play in these essential functions, and as
we will see, trauma can interfere with every one of them.

Our rational, cognitive brain is actually the youngest part of the brain
and occupies only about 30 percent of the area inside our skull. The rational
brain is primarily concerned with the world outside us: understanding how
things and people work and figuring out how to accomplish our goals,
manage our time, and sequence our actions. Beneath the rational brain lie
two evolutionarily older, and to some degree separate, brains, which are in
charge of everything else: the moment-by-moment registration and
management of our body’s physiology and the identification of comfort,
safety, threat, hunger, fatigue, desire, longing, excitement, pleasure, and
pain.

<h2>Brain Stem - The Reptilian Brain</h2>
The brain is built from the bottom up. It develops level by level within
every child in the womb, just as it did in the course of evolution. The most
primitive part, the part that is already online when we are born, is the
ancient animal brain, often called the reptilian brain. It is located in the
brain stem, just above the place where our spinal cord enters the skull. The
reptilian brain is responsible for all the things that newborn babies can do:
eat, 
sleep, 
wake, 
cry, 
breathe; 
feel temperature, 
hunger, 
wetness, and pain;
and rid the body of toxins by urinating and defecating. 

The brain stem and
the hypothalamus (which sits directly above it) together control the energy
levels of the body. They coordinate the functioning of the heart and lungs
and also the endocrine and immune systems, ensuring that these basic lifesustaining
systems are maintained within the relatively stable internal
balance known as homeostasis.

Breathing, eating, sleeping, pooping, and peeing are so fundamental
that their significance is easily neglected when we’re considering the
complexities of mind and behavior. However, if your sleep is disturbed or
your bowels don’t work, or if you always feel hungry, or if being touched
makes you want to scream (as is often the case with traumatized children
and adults), the entire organism is thrown into disequilibrium. It is amazing
how many psychological problems involve difficulties with sleep, appetite,
touch, digestion, and arousal. Any effective treatment for trauma has to
address these basic housekeeping functions of the body.

<h2>Limbic System - The Mammalian Brain</h2>

Right above the reptilian brain is the limbic system. It’s also known as
the mammalian brain, because all animals that live in groups and nurture
their young possess one. Development of this part of the brain truly takes
off after a baby is born. It is the seat of the emotions, the monitor of danger,
the judge of what is pleasurable or scary, the arbiter of what is or is not
important for survival purposes. It is also a central command post for
coping with the challenges of living within our complex social networks.
The limbic system is shaped in response to experience, in partnership
with the infant’s own genetic makeup and inborn temperament. (As all
parents of more than one child quickly notice, babies differ from birth in the
intensity and nature of their reactions to similar events.) Whatever happens
to a baby contributes to the emotional and perceptual map of the world that
its developing brain creates. As my colleague Bruce Perry explains it, the
brain is formed in a “use-dependent manner.”5 This is another way of
describing neuroplasticity, the relatively recent discovery that neurons that
“fire together, wire together.” When a circuit fires repeatedly, it can become
a default setting—the response most likely to occur. If you feel safe and
loved, your brain becomes specialized in exploration, play, and cooperation;
if you are frightened and unwanted, it specializes in managing feelings of
fear and abandonment.
As infants and toddlers we learn about the world by moving, grabbing,
and crawling and by discovering what happens when we cry, smile, or
protest. We are constantly experimenting with our surroundings—how do
our interactions change the way our bodies feel? Attend any two-year-old’s
birthday party and notice how little Kimberly will engage you, play with
you, flirt with you, without any need for language. These early explorations
shape the limbic structures devoted to emotions and memory, but these
structures can also be significantly modified by later experiences: for the
better by a close friendship or a beautiful first love, for example, or for the
worse by a violent assault, relentless bullying, or neglect.

<h2>Emotional Brain</h2>
Taken together the reptilian brain and limbic system make up what I’ll
call the “emotional brain” throughout this book. The emotional brain is at
the heart of the central nervous system, and its key task is to look out for
your welfare. If it detects danger or a special opportunity—such as a
promising partner—it alerts you by releasing a squirt of hormones. The
resulting visceral sensations (ranging from mild queasiness to the grip of
panic in your chest) will interfere with whatever your mind is currently
focused on and get you moving—physically and mentally—in a different
direction. Even at their most subtle, these sensations have a huge influence
on the small and large decisions we make throughout our lives: what we
choose to eat, where we like to sleep and with whom, what music we prefer,
whether we like to garden or sing in a choir, and whom we befriend and
whom we detest.

<h2>Neocortex - Our rational brain</h2>

The emotional brain’s cellular organization and biochemistry are
simpler than those of the neocortex, our rational brain, and it assesses
incoming information in a more global way. As a result, it jumps to
conclusions based on rough similarities, in contrast with the rational brain,
which is organized to sort through a complex set of options. (The textbook
example is leaping back in terror when you see a snake—only to realize that
it’s just a coiled rope.) The emotional brain initiates preprogrammed escape
plans, like the fight-or-flight responses. These muscular and physiological
reactions are automatic, set in motion without any thought or planning on
our part, leaving our conscious, rational capacities to catch up later, often
well after the threat is over.
Finally we reach the top layer of the brain, the neocortex. We share this
outer layer with other mammals, but it is much thicker in us humans. In the
second year of life the frontal lobes, which make up the bulk of our
neocortex, begin to develop at a rapid pace. The ancient philosophers called
seven years “the age of reason.” For us first grade is the prelude of things to
come, a life organized around frontal-lobe capacities: sitting still; keeping
sphincters in check; being able to use words rather than acting out;
understanding abstract and symbolic ideas; planning for tomorrow; and
being in tune with teachers and classmates.

The frontal lobes are responsible for the qualities that make us unique
within the animal kingdom. They enable us to use language and abstract
thought. They give us our ability to absorb and integrate vast amounts of
information and attach meaning to it. Despite our excitement about the
linguistic feats of chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys, only human beings
command the words and symbols necessary to create the communal,
spiritual, and historical contexts that shape our lives.
The frontal lobes allow us to plan and reflect, to imagine and play out
future scenarios. They help us to predict what will happen if we take one
action (like applying for a new job) or neglect another (not paying the rent).
They make choice possible and underlie our astonishing creativity.
Generations of frontal lobes, working in close collaboration, have created
culture, which got us from dug-out canoes, horse-drawn carriages, and
letters to jet planes, hybrid cars, and e-mail. They also gave us Noam’s
lifesaving trampoline.

<h2>MIRRORING EACH OTHER: INTERPERSONAL NEUROBIOLOGY</h2>

Crucial for understanding trauma, the frontal lobes are also the seat of
empathy—our ability to “feel into” someone else. One of the truly
sensational discoveries of modern neuroscience took place in 1994, when in
a lucky accident a group of Italian scientists identified specialized cells in
the cortex that came to be known as mirror neurons.8 The researchers had
attached electrodes to individual neurons in a monkey’s premotor area, then
set up a computer to monitor precisely which neurons fired when the
monkey picked up a peanut or grasped a banana. At one point an
experimenter was putting food pellets into a box when he looked up at the
computer. The monkey’s brain cells were firing at the exact location where
the motor command neurons were located. But the monkey wasn’t eating or
moving. He was watching the researcher, and his brain was vicariously
mirroring the researcher’s actions.
Numerous other experiments followed around the world, and it soon
became clear that mirror neurons explained many previously unexplainable
aspects of the mind, such as empathy, imitation, synchrony, and even the
development of language. One writer compared mirror neurons to “neural
WiFi”9—we pick up not only another person’s movement but her emotional
state and intentions as well. When people are in sync with each other, they
tend to stand or sit similar ways, and their voices take on the same rhythms.
But our mirror neurons also make us vulnerable to others’ negativity, so that
we respond to their anger with fury or are dragged down by their
depression. I’ll have more to say about mirror neurons later in this book,
because trauma almost invariably involves not being seen, not being
mirrored, and not being taken into account. Treatment needs to reactivate
the capacity to safely mirror, and be mirrored, by others, but also to resist
being hijacked by others’ negative emotions.

<i>The Triune (Three-part) Brain. The brain develops from the bottom up. 
The reptilian brain develops in the womb and organizes basic life sustaining functions. It is highly responsive to
threat throughout our entire life span. 

The limbic system is organized mainly during the first six
years of life but continues to evolve in a use-dependent manner. Trauma can have a major
impact of its functioning throughout life. 

The prefrontal cortex develops last, and also is
affected by trauma exposure, including being unable to filter out irrelevant information.
Throughout life it is vulnerable to go off-line in response to threat.</i>

As anybody who has worked with brain-damaged people or taken care
of demented parents has learned the hard way, well-functioning frontal
lobes are crucial for harmonious relationships with our fellow humans.
Realizing that other people can think and feel differently from us is a huge
developmental step for two- and three-year-olds. They learn to understand
others’ motives, so they can adapt and stay safe in groups that have
different perceptions, expectations, and values. Without flexible, active
frontal lobes people become creatures of habit, and their relationships
become superficial and routine. Invention and innovation, discovery and
wonder—all are lacking.
Our frontal lobes can also (sometimes, but not always) stop us from
doing things that will embarrass us or hurt others. We don’t have to eat
every time we’re hungry, kiss anybody who rouses our desires, or blow up
every time we’re angry. But it is exactly on that edge between impulse and
acceptable behavior where most of our troubles begin. The more intense the
visceral, sensory input from the emotional brain, the less capacity the
rational brain has to put a damper on it.

<h2>IDENTIFYING DANGER: THE COOK AND THE SMOKE DETECTOR</h2>

Danger is a normal part of life, and the brain is in charge of detecting it and
organizing our response. Sensory information about the outside world
arrives through our eyes, nose, ears, and skin. These sensations converge in
the thalamus, an area inside the limbic system that acts as the “cook” within
the brain. The thalamus stirs all the input from our perceptions into a fully
blended autobiographical soup, an integrated, coherent experience of “this
is what is happening to me.”10 The sensations are then passed on in two
directions—down to the amygdala, two small almond-shaped structures that
lie deeper in the limbic, unconscious brain, and up to the frontal lobes,
where they reach our conscious awareness. The neuroscientist Joseph
LeDoux calls the pathway to the amygdala “the low road,” which is
extremely fast, and that to the frontal cortex the “high road,” which takes
several milliseconds longer in the midst of an overwhelmingly threatening
experience. However, processing by the thalamus can break down. Sights,
sounds, smells, and touch are encoded as isolated, dissociated fragments,
and normal memory processing disintegrates. Time freezes, so that the
present danger feels like it will last forever.

The central function of the amygdala, which I call the brain’s smoke
detector, is to identify whether incoming input is relevant for our survival.11
It does so quickly and automatically, with the help of feedback from the
hippocampus, a nearby structure that relates the new input to past
experiences. If the amygdala senses a threat—a potential collision with an
oncoming vehicle, a person on the street who looks threatening—it sends an
instant message down to the hypothalamus and the brain stem, recruiting
the stress-hormone system and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to
orchestrate a whole-body response. Because the amygdala processes the
information it receives from the thalamus faster than the frontal lobes do, it
decides whether incoming information is a threat to our survival even
before we are consciously aware of the danger. By the time we realize what
is happening, our body may already be on the move.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXaeDn7KEQbOiQVlNPBeMQUZ8bGYNEX4x8C-kO5Qeg-O8lbLKtDqkHUaYNyBGC4Yc6VPwIK6mifWbJ8d51dG9awEmIT1IOAVy73lkqsfMuPPZAboMuAd6IpapBhu1sfpGFn9ZvJqCK-mf-NWUdrK2I8sh_YRJCznqpGAlf7lfmVV0yxg5pRo2xRMY3UA/s703/4.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="600" data-original-height="475" data-original-width="703" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXaeDn7KEQbOiQVlNPBeMQUZ8bGYNEX4x8C-kO5Qeg-O8lbLKtDqkHUaYNyBGC4Yc6VPwIK6mifWbJ8d51dG9awEmIT1IOAVy73lkqsfMuPPZAboMuAd6IpapBhu1sfpGFn9ZvJqCK-mf-NWUdrK2I8sh_YRJCznqpGAlf7lfmVV0yxg5pRo2xRMY3UA/s600/4.png"/></a></div>


<b>The emotional brain has first dibs on interpreting incoming information. </b>

<i>Sensory Information about the environment and body state received by the eyes, ears, touch, kinesthetic
sense, etc., converges on the thalamus, where it is processed, and then passed on to the
amygdala to interpret its emotional significance. This occurs with lightning speed. If a threat is
detected the amygdala sends messages to the hypothalamus to secrete stress hormones to
defend against that threat. The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux calls this the low road. 

The second neural pathway, the high road, runs from the thalamus, via the hippocampus and
anterior cingulate, to the prefrontal cortex, the rational brain, for a conscious and much more
refined interpretation. This takes several microseconds longer. If the interpretation of threat by
the amygdala is too intense, and/or the filtering system from the higher areas of the brain are
too weak, as often happens in PTSD, people lose control over automatic emergency responses,
like prolonged startle or aggressive outbursts. </i>

The amygdala’s danger signals trigger the release of powerful stress
hormones, including cortisol and adrenaline, which increase heart rate,
blood pressure, and rate of breathing, preparing us to fight back or run
away. Once the danger is past, the body returns to its normal state fairly
quickly. But when recovery is blocked, the body is triggered to defend
itself, which makes people feel agitated and aroused.
While the smoke detector is usually pretty good at picking up danger
clues, trauma increases the risk of misinterpreting whether a particular
situation is dangerous or safe. You can get along with other people only if
you can accurately gauge whether their intentions are benign or dangerous.
Even a slight misreading can lead to painful misunderstandings in
relationships at home and at work. Functioning effectively in a complex
work environment or a household filled with rambunctious kids requires the
ability to quickly assess how people are feeling and continuously adjusting
your behavior accordingly. Faulty alarm systems lead to blowups or
shutdowns in response to innocuous comments or facial expressions.

<h2>CONTROLLING THE STRESS RESPONSE: THE WATCHTOWER</h2>

If the amygdala is the smoke detector in the brain, think of the frontal lobes
—and specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC),12 located directly
above our eyes—as the watchtower, offering a view of the scene from on
high. Is that smoke you smell the sign that your house is on fire and you
need to get out, fast—or is it coming from the steak you put over too high a
flame? The amygdala doesn’t make such judgments; it just gets you ready
to fight back or escape, even before the frontal lobes get a chance to weigh
in with their assessment. As long as you are not too upset, your frontal
lobes can restore your balance by helping you realize that you are
responding to a false alarm and abort the stress response.
Ordinarily the executive capacities of the prefrontal cortex enable
people to observe what is going on, predict what will happen if they take a
certain action, and make a conscious choice. Being able to hover calmly
and objectively over our thoughts, feelings, and emotions (an ability I’ll call
mindfulness throughout this book) and then take our time to respond allows
the executive brain to inhibit, organize, and modulate the hardwired
automatic reactions preprogrammed into the emotional brain. This capacity
is crucial for preserving our relationships with our fellow human beings. As
long as our frontal lobes are working properly, we’re unlikely to lose our
temper every time a waiter is late with our order or an insurance company
agent puts us on hold. (Our watchtower also tells us that other people’s
anger and threats are a function of their emotional state.) When that system
breaks down, we become like conditioned animals: The moment we detect
danger we automatically go into fight-or-flight mode.

<b>Top down or bottom up. </b>

<i>Structures in the emotional brain decide what we perceive as
dangerous or safe. There are two ways of changing the threat detection system: from the top
down, via modulating messages from the medial prefrontal cortex (not just prefrontal cortex),
or from the bottom up, via the reptilian brain, through breathing, movement, and touch.</i>

In PTSD the critical balance between the amygdala (smoke detector)
and the MPFC (watchtower) shifts radically, which makes it much harder to
control emotions and impulses. Neuroimaging studies of human beings in
highly emotional states reveal that intense fear, sadness, and anger all
increase the activation of subcortical brain regions involved in emotions
and significantly reduce the activity in various areas in the frontal lobe,
particularly the MPFC. When that occurs, the inhibitory capacities of the
frontal lobe break down, and people “take leave of their senses”: They may
startle in response to any loud sound, become enraged by small frustrations,
or freeze when somebody touches them.

Effectively dealing with stress depends upon achieving a balance
between the smoke detector and the watchtower. If you want to manage
your emotions better, your brain gives you two options: You can learn to
regulate them from the top down or from the bottom up.
Knowing the difference between top down and bottom up regulation is
central for understanding and treating traumatic stress. Top-down regulation
involves strengthening the capacity of the watchtower to monitor your
body’s sensations. Mindfulness meditation and yoga can help with this.
Bottom-up regulation involves recalibrating the autonomic nervous system,
(which, as we have seen, originates in the brain stem). We can access the
ANS through breath, movement, or touch. Breathing is one of the few body
functions under both conscious and autonomic control. In part 5 of this
book we’ll explore specific techniques for increasing both top-down and
bottom-up regulation.

<h2>THE RIDER AND THE HORSE</h2>

For now I want to emphasize that emotion is not opposed to reason; our
emotions assign value to experiences and thus are the foundation of reason.
Our self-experience is the product of the balance between our rational and
our emotional brains. When these two systems are in balance, we “feel like
ourselves.” However, when our survival is at stake, these systems can
function relatively independently.
If, say, you are driving along, chatting with a friend, and a truck
suddenly looms in the corner of your eye, you instantly stop talking, slam
on the brakes, and turn your steering wheel to get out of harm’s way. If your
instinctive actions have saved you from a collision, you may resume where
you left off. Whether you are able to do so depends largely on how quickly
your visceral reactions subside to the threat.
The neuroscientist Paul MacLean, who developed the three-part
description of the brain that I’ve used here, compared the relationship
between the rational brain and the emotional brain to that between a more
or less competent rider and his unruly horse. As long as the weather is
calm and the path is smooth, the rider can feel in excellent control. But
unexpected sounds or threats from other animals can make the horse bolt,
forcing the rider to hold on for dear life. Likewise, when people feel that
their survival is at stake or they are seized by rages, longings, fear, or sexual
desires, they stop listening to the voice of reason, and it makes little sense
to argue with them. Whenever the limbic system decides that something is a
question of life or death, the pathways between the frontal lobes and the
limbic system become extremely tenuous.
Psychologists usually try to help people use insight and understanding
to manage their behavior. However, neuroscience research shows that very
few psychological problems are the result of defects in understanding; most
originate in pressures from deeper regions in the brain that drive our
perception and attention. When the alarm bell of the emotional brain keeps
signaling that you are in danger, no amount of insight will silence it. I am
reminded of the comedy in which a seven-time recidivist in an angermanagement
program extols the virtue of the techniques he’s learned:
“They are great and work terrific—as long as you are not really angry.”
When our emotional and rational brains are in conflict (as when we’re
enraged with someone we love, frightened by someone we depend on, or
lust after someone who is off limits), a tug-of-war ensues. This war is
largely played out in the theater of visceral experience—your gut, your
heart, your lungs—and will lead to both physical discomfort and
psychological misery. Chapter 6 will discuss how the brain and viscera
interact in safety and danger, which is key to understanding the many
physical manifestations of trauma.
I’d like to end this chapter by examining two more brain scans that
illustrate some of the core features of traumatic stress: timeless reliving;
reexperiencing images, sounds, and emotions; and dissociation.

<h2>STAN AND UTE’S BRAINS ON TRAUMA</h2>

On a fine September morning in 1999, Stan and Ute Lawrence, a
professional couple in their forties, set out from their home in London,
Ontario, to attend a business meeting in Detroit. Halfway through the
journey they ran into a wall of dense fog that reduced visibility to zero in a
split second. Stan immediately slammed on the brakes, coming to a
standstill sideways on the highway, just missing a huge truck. An eighteenwheeler
went flying over the trunk of their car; vans and cars slammed into
them and into each other. People who got out of their cars were hit as they
ran for their lives. The ear-splitting crashes went on and on—with each jolt
from behind they felt this would be the one that killed them. Stan and Ute
were trapped in car number thirteen of an eighty-seven-car pileup, the worst
road disaster in Canadian history.15
Then came the eerie silence. Stan struggled to open the doors and
windows, but the eighteen-wheeler that had crushed their trunk was wedged
against the car. Suddenly, someone was pounding on their roof. A girl was
screaming, “Get me out of here—I’m on fire!” Helplessly, they saw her die
as the car she’d been in was consumed by flames. The next thing they
knew, a truck driver was standing on the hood of their car with a fire
extinguisher. He smashed the windshield to free them, and Stan climbed
through the opening. Turning around to help his wife, he saw Ute sitting
frozen in her seat. Stan and the truck driver lifted her out and an ambulance
took them to an emergency room. Aside from a few cuts, they were found
to be physically unscathed.
At home that night, neither Stan nor Ute wanted to go to sleep. They
felt that if they let go, they would die. They were irritable, jumpy, and on
edge. That night, and for many to come, they drank copious quantities of
wine to numb their fear. They could not stop the images that were haunting
them or the questions that went on and on: What if they’d left earlier? What
if they hadn’t stopped for gas? After three months of this, they sought help
from Dr. Ruth Lanius, a psychiatrist at the University of Western Ontario.
Dr. Lanius, who had been my student at the Trauma Center a few years
earlier, told Stan and Ute she wanted to visualize their brains with an fMRI
scan before beginning treatment. The fMRI measures neural activity by
tracking changes in blood flow in the brain, and unlike the PET scan, it
does not require exposure to radiation. Dr. Lanius used the same kind of
script-driven imagery we had used at Harvard, capturing the images,
sounds, smells, and other sensations Stan and Ute had experienced while
they were trapped in the car.
Stan went first and immediately went into a flashback, just as Marsha
had in our Harvard study. He came out of the scanner sweating, with his
heart racing and his blood pressure sky high. “This was just the way I felt
during the accident,” he reported. “I was sure I was going to die, and there
was nothing I could do to save myself.” Instead of remembering the
accident as something that had happened three months earlier, Stan was
reliving it.

<h2>DISSOCIATION AND RELIVING</h2>

Dissociation is the essence of trauma. The overwhelming experience is split
off and fragmented, so that the emotions, sounds, images, thoughts, and
physical sensations related to the trauma take on a life of their own. The
sensory fragments of memory intrude into the present, where they are
literally relived. As long as the trauma is not resolved, the stress hormones
that the body secretes to protect itself keep circulating, and the defensive
movements and emotional responses keep getting replayed. Unlike Stan,
however, many people may not be aware of the connection between their
“crazy” feelings and reactions and the traumatic events that are being
replayed. They have no idea why they respond to some minor irritation as if
they were about to be annihilated.
Flashbacks and reliving are in some ways worse that the trauma itself.
A traumatic event has a beginning and an end—at some point it is over. But
for people with PTSD a flashback can occur at any time, whether they are
awake or asleep. There is no way of knowing when it’s going to occur again
or how long it will last. People who suffer from flashbacks often organize
their lives around trying to protect against them. They may compulsively go
to the gym to pump iron (but finding that they are never strong enough),
numb themselves with drugs, or try to cultivate an illusory sense of control
in highly dangerous situations (like motorcycle racing, bungee jumping, or
working as an ambulance driver). Constantly fighting unseen dangers is
exhausting and leaves them fatigued, depressed, and weary.
If elements of the trauma are replayed again and again, the
accompanying stress hormones engrave those memories ever more deeply
in the mind. Ordinary, day-to-day events become less and less compelling.
Not being able to deeply take in what is going on around them makes it
impossible to feel fully alive. It becomes harder to feel the joys and
aggravations of ordinary life, harder to concentrate on the tasks at hand. Not
being fully alive in the present keeps them more firmly imprisoned in the
past.
Triggered responses manifest in various ways. Veterans may react to
the slightest cue—like hitting a bump in the road or a seeing a kid playing
in the street—as if they were in a war zone. They startle easily and become
enraged or numb. Victims of childhood sexual abuse may anesthetize their
sexuality and then feel intensely ashamed if they become excited by
sensations or images that recall their molestation, even when those
sensations are the natural pleasures associated with particular body parts. If
trauma survivors are forced to discuss their experiences, one person’s blood
pressure may increase while another responds with the beginnings of a
migraine headache. Still others may shut down emotionally and not feel any
obvious changes. However, in the lab we have no problem detecting their
racing hearts and the stress hormones churning through their bodies.
These reactions are irrational and largely outside people’s control.
Intense and barely controllable urges and emotions make people feel crazy
—and makes them feel they don’t belong to the human race. Feeling numb
during birthday parties for your kids or in response to the death of loved
ones makes people feel like monsters. As a result, shame becomes the
dominant emotion and hiding the truth the central preoccupation.
They are rarely in touch with the origins of their alienation. That is
where therapy comes in—is the beginning of bringing the emotions that
were generated by trauma being able to feel, the capacity to observe oneself
online. However, the bottom line is that the threat-perception system of the
brain has changed, and people’s physical reactions are dictated by the
imprint of the past.
The trauma that started “out there” is now played out on the battlefield
of their own bodies, usually without a conscious connection between what
happened back then and what is going on right now inside. The challenge is
not so much learning to accept the terrible things that have happened but
learning how to gain mastery over one’s internal sensations and emotions.
Sensing, naming, and identifying what is going on inside is the first step to
recovery.

<h2>THE SMOKE DETECTOR GOES ON OVERDRIVE</h2>

Stan’s brain scan shows his flashback in action. This is what reliving trauma
looks like in the brain: the brightly lit area in the lower right-hand corner,
the blanked-out lower left side, and the four symmetrical white holes
around the center. (You may recognize the lit-up amygdala and the off-line
left brain from the Harvard study discussed in chapter 3.) Stan’s amygdala
made no distinction between past and present. It activated just as if the car
crash were happening in the scanner, triggering powerful stress hormones
and nervous-system responses. These were responsible for his sweating and
trembling, his racing heart and elevated blood pressure: entirely normal and
potentially lifesaving responses if a truck has just smashed into your car.

It’s important to have an efficient smoke detector: You don’t want to
get caught unawares by a raging fire. But if you go into a frenzy every time
you smell smoke, it becomes intensely disruptive. Yes, you need to detect
whether somebody is getting upset with you, but if your amygdala goes into
overdrive, you may become chronically scared that people hate you, or you
may feel like they are out to get you.

<h2>THE TIMEKEEPER COLLAPSES</h2>

Both Stan and Ute had become hypersensitive and irritable after the
accident, suggesting that their prefrontal cortex was struggling to maintain
control in the face of stress. Stan’s flashback precipitated a more extreme
reaction.
The two white areas in the front of the brain (on top in the picture) are
the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. When those areas are
deactivated, people lose their sense of time and become trapped in the
moment, without a sense of past, present, or future.16
Two brain systems are relevant for the mental processing of trauma:
those dealing with emotional intensity and context. Emotional intensity is
defined by the smoke alarm, the amygdala, and its counterweight, the
watchtower, the medial prefrontal cortex. The context and meaning of an
experience are determined by the system that includes the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the hippocampus. The DLPFC is located to
the side in the front brain, while the MPFC is in the center. The structures
along the midline of the brain are devoted to your inner experience of
yourself, those on the side are more concerned with your relationship with
your surroundings.
The DLPFC tells us how our present experience relates to the past and
how it may affect the future—you can think of it as the timekeeper of the
brain. Knowing that whatever is happening is finite and will sooner or later
come to an end makes most experiences tolerable. The opposite is also true
—situations become intolerable if they feel interminable. Most of us know
from sad personal experience that terrible grief is typically accompanied by
the sense that this wretched state will last forever, and that we will never get
over our loss. Trauma is the ultimate experience of “this will last forever.”
Stan’s scan reveals why people can recover from trauma only when the
brain structures that were knocked out during the original experience—
which is why the event registered in the brain as trauma in the first place—
are fully online. Visiting the past in therapy should be done while people
are, biologically speaking, firmly rooted in the present and feeling as calm,
safe, and grounded as possible. (“Grounded” means that you can feel your
butt in your chair, see the light coming through the window, feel the tension
in your calves, and hear the wind stirring the tree outside.) Being anchored
in the present while revisiting the trauma opens the possibility of deeply
knowing that the terrible events belong to the past. For that to happen, the
brain’s watchtower, cook, and timekeeper need to be online. Therapy won’t
work as long as people keep being pulled back into the past.

<h2>THE THALAMUS SHUTS DOWN</h2>

Look again at the scan of Stan’s flashback, and you can see two more white
holes in the lower half of the brain. These are his right and left thalamus—
blanked out during the flashback as they were during the original trauma.
As I’ve said, the thalamus functions as a “cook”—a relay station that
collects sensations from the ears, eyes, and skin and integrates them into the
soup that is our autobiographical memory. Breakdown of the thalamus
explains why trauma is primarily remembered not as a story, a narrative
with a beginning middle and end, but as isolated sensory imprints: images,
sounds, and physical sensations that are accompanied by intense emotions,
usually terror and helplessness.17
In normal circumstances the thalamus also acts as a filter or gatekeeper.
This makes it a central component of attention, concentration, and new
learning—all of which are compromised by trauma. As you sit here reading,
you may hear music in the background or traffic rumbling by or feel a faint
gnawing in your stomach telling you it’s time for a snack. If you are able to
stay focused on this page, your thalamus is helping you distinguish between
sensory information that is relevant and information that you can safely
ignore. In chapter 19, on neurofeedback, I’ll discuss some of the tests we
use to measure how well this gating system works, as well as ways to
strengthen it.
People with PTSD have their floodgates wide open. Lacking a filter,
they are on constant sensory overload. In order to cope, they try to shut
themselves down and develop tunnel vision and hyperfocus. If they can’t
shut down naturally, they may enlist drugs or alcohol to block out the
world. The tragedy is that the price of closing down includes filtering out
sources of pleasure and joy, as well.

<h2>DEPERSONALIZATION: SPLIT OFF FROM THE SELF</h2>

Let’s now look at Ute’s experience in the scanner. Not all people react to
trauma in exactly the same way, but in this case the difference is
particularly dramatic, since Ute was sitting right next to Stan in the wrecked
car. She responded to her trauma script by going numb: Her mind went
blank, and nearly every area of her brain showed markedly decreased
activity. Her heart rate and blood pressure didn’t elevate. When asked how
she’d felt during the scan, she replied: “I felt just like I felt at the time of the
accident: I felt nothing.”

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXqcPZ6qdgKBqsEkzHNE_qJ68cEQ1NsoN1wEasU6Tf-eQUZ_fB4N2EuKjDQsuOIb21MbTyJHPgh66D4lsGJUt1F-ns1L2peJ6vMr4RqAI1Xwo_OmUYyyAsB7nCIr11G0cPMNB4KQKZC5IsJ1Hu_BnlMDaxrlwBWuf1uM9wltTA9mSZ08pRR6vx4emuXQ/s799/7.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="600" data-original-height="799" data-original-width="625" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXqcPZ6qdgKBqsEkzHNE_qJ68cEQ1NsoN1wEasU6Tf-eQUZ_fB4N2EuKjDQsuOIb21MbTyJHPgh66D4lsGJUt1F-ns1L2peJ6vMr4RqAI1Xwo_OmUYyyAsB7nCIr11G0cPMNB4KQKZC5IsJ1Hu_BnlMDaxrlwBWuf1uM9wltTA9mSZ08pRR6vx4emuXQ/s600/7.png"/></a></div>

<i>Blanking out (dissociation) in response to being reminded of past trauma. In this case
almost every area of the brain has decreased activation, interfering with thinking, focus, and
orientation.</i>

The medical term for Ute’s response is depersonalization.18 Anyone
who deals with traumatized men, women, or children is sooner or later
confronted with blank stares and absent minds, the outward manifestation
of the biological freeze reaction. Depersonalization is one symptom of the
massive dissociation created by trauma. Stan’s flashbacks came from his
thwarted efforts to escape the crash—cued by the script, all his dissociated,
fragmented sensations and emotions roared back into the present. But
instead of struggling to escape, Ute had dissociated her fear and felt
nothing.

I see depersonalization regularly in my office when patients tell me
horrendous stories without any feeling. All the energy drains out of the
room, and I have to make a valiant effort to keep paying attention. A lifeless
patient forces you to work much harder to keep the therapy alive, and I
often used to pray for the hour to be over quickly.
After seeing Ute’s scan, I started to take a very different approach
toward blanked-out patients. With nearly every part of their brains tuned
out, they obviously cannot think, feel deeply, remember, or make sense out
of what is going on. Conventional talk therapy, in those circumstances, is
virtually useless.
In Ute’s case it was possible to guess why she responded so differently
from Stan. She was utilizing a survival strategy her brain had learned in
childhood to cope with her mother’s harsh treatment. Ute’s father died when
she was nine years old, and her mother subsequently was often nasty and
demeaning to her. At some point Ute discovered that she could blank out
her mind when her mother yelled at her. Thirty-five years later, when she
was trapped in her demolished car, Ute’s brain automatically went into the
same survival mode—she made herself disappear.
The challenge for people like Ute is to become alert and engaged, a
difficult but unavoidable task if they want to recapture their lives. (Ute
herself did recover—she wrote a book about her experiences and started a
successful journal called Mental Fitness.) This is where a bottom-up
approach to therapy becomes essential. The aim is actually to change the
patient’s physiology, his or her relationship to bodily sensations. At the
Trauma Center we work with such basic measures as heart rate and
breathing patterns. We help patients evoke and notice bodily sensations by
tapping acupressure19 points. Rhythmic interactions with other people are
also effective—tossing a beach ball back and forth, bouncing on a Pilates
ball, drumming, or dancing to music.
Numbing is the other side of the coin in PTSD. Many untreated trauma
survivors start out like Stan, with explosive flashbacks, then numb out later
in life. While reliving trauma is dramatic, frightening, and potentially selfdestructive,
over time a lack of presence can be even more damaging. This
is a particular problem with traumatized children. The acting-out kids tend
to get attention; the blanked-out ones don’t bother anybody and are left to
lose their future bit by bit.

<h2>LEARNING TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT</h2>

The challenge of trauma treatment is not only dealing with the past but,
even more, enhancing the quality of day-to-day experience. One reason that
traumatic memories become dominant in PTSD is that it’s so difficult to
feel truly alive right now. When you can’t be fully here, you go to the
places where you did feel alive—even if those places are filled with horror
and misery.
Many treatment approaches for traumatic stress focus on desensitizing
patients to their past, with the expectation that reexposure to their traumas
will reduce emotional outbursts and flashbacks. I believe that this is based
on a misunderstanding of what happens in traumatic stress. We must most
of all help our patients to live fully and securely in the present. In order to
do that, we need to help bring those brain structures that deserted them
when they were overwhelmed by trauma back. Desensitization may make
you less reactive, but if you cannot feel satisfaction in ordinary everyday
things like taking a walk, cooking a meal, or playing with your kids, life
will pass you by.
