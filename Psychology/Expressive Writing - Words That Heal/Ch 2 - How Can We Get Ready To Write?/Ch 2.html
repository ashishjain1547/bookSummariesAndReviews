<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#555555">What Should You Write?</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>Write about what keeps you awake at night.</li>
<li>Write to learn where you need to go.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000">Trust where your writing takes you. You may start with a trauma / emotional upheaval but soon begin writing about other topics. As long as these other topics are emotionally important, follow them. If, however, you find yourself writing about what you would like for dinner — or some other distracting topic — then force yourself back to the trauma / emotional upheaval.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"># Write about issues relevant to the here and now.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"># Write only about traumas that are present in your mind.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#555555">Write only about traumas that are present in your mind.</font></h1>
<p><font color="#000000">A remarkable amount of literature deals with repressed memories. The repressed memory literature explores the idea that people have had horrible childhood experiences that they don’t remember — many of which involved childhood sexual abuse. The writing you are doing here focuses on what you are aware of now. If you have no memory of a given childhood experience, why not go with the working assumption that it never happened? After all, you wouldn’t know the difference anyway. Write only about conscious traumas and upheavals. It will save you thousands of dollars in therapy and legal bills.</font></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#555555">How Much Time Should You Write?</font></h1>
<p><b><font color="#000000">How frequently to write.</b></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000">While there is some debate about whether it is better to write for four consecutive days or to separate your writing days, there is nothing conclusive either way.</i></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">How long for each session.</b></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000">In most large-scale studies, people wrote for around twenty minutes on three to four occasions.</i></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">How many days to write.</b></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000">What if you find that you enjoy writing and want to continue past four days? Do it.</i></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000"></i></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Booster-writing sessions</b></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000">Think of expressive writing as a tool always be at your disposal, or like having medicine in your medicine cabinet. No need to take the medicine when you are healthy, but when you are under the weather, you can always turn to it. Once you have tried writing as a healing agent, try it again when you need to. Also, you might find that in the future, you won’t need to write for four days, twenty minutes a day. Merely writing occasionally when something bothers you might be sufficient.</i></font></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#555555">Writing prescription: To Journal or Not to Journal?</font></h1>
<p><font color="#000000">Sometimes a healthcare provider may tell a patient, “You should write about that in a journal,” but that’s as far as the prescription goes. You may wonder, is keeping a daily journal a good idea? Ironically, there is no clear evidence that keeping a daily journal or diary is good for your health, perhaps in part because once people get in the habit of writing every day, they devote less and less time to dealing with important psychological issues. Sometimes a journal can become a worn path with little benefit.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Writing in a journal about the same trauma, using the same words, expressing the same feelings over and over is a bit like the grandmother in Eudora Welty’s story, A Worn Path. The woman in this story travels the same path every year at the same time, seeking medicine for a child who died years before. No medicine will bring back the grandmother’s dead child. Writing in a journal every day about that same issue with the same words in the same way will probably not bring the relief you seek and may actually do more harm than good.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">My own experience is that journal writing works best on an as-needed basis as a life-course correction. If your life is going well, you are happy, and are not obsessing about things in the past, why over analyze yourself?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Let it go and enjoy life as it comes. It is safe to say that some future miseries will visit you again. When they happen, do some expressive writing to deal with them.</font></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#555555">When Should You Write?</font></h1>
<p><b><font color="#000000">How soon after a Trauma / Emotional Upheaval? </b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"># Recent trauma / emotional upheaval</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"># Present trauma / emotional upheaval</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"># Past trauma / emotional upheaval</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"># Future trauma / emotional upheaval: Is it helpful to write about the eventual death of a loved one? Or a divorce that you know is coming? Or something else in the future? Sure, why not? It’s free. But in your writing, explore why you are having the feelings and how these feelings relate to other issues in your life. Remember that the point of this writing is how we make sense of a troubling experience or event and how we incorporate that experience into the entire story of our lives.</font></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#555555">Some Questions To Ponder Over</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>Is This a Good Time in Your Life to Write?</li>
<li>What’s the Best Time of Day to Write?</li>
<li>Where Should You Write?</li>
<li>What Technology Do You Need to Write?</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Think about:</b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"></b></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000"># Creating a unique environment.</i></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000"></i></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000"># Creating a ritual for writing.</i></font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000"></i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><font color="#555555">And Finally, The Flip-Out Rule</font></h1>
<p><font color="#000000">I hereby declare you ready to begin your expressive writing experience.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">But before you start, it is important to review The Flip-Out Rule.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><i><b><font color="#000000">If you feel that writing about a particular topic is too much for you to handle, then do not write about it. If you know that you aren’t ready to address a particularly painful topic, then write about something else. When you are ready, then tackle the other topic. If you feel that you will flip out by writing, don’t write.</b></i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">What could be simpler?</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Enjoy your writing.</font></p>
