    The Miracle of Mindfulness was originally written in Vietnamese as a long
    letter to Brother Quang, a main staff member of the School of Youth for
    Social Service in South Vietnam in 1974. Its author, the Buddhist monk Thich
    Nhat Hanh, had founded the School in the 1960s as an outgrowth of “engaged
    Buddhism.” It drew young people deeply committed to acting in a spirit of
    compassion. Upon graduation, the students used the training they received to
    respond to the needs of peasants caught in the turmoil of the war. They helped
    rebuild bombed villages, teach children, set up medical stations, and
    organize agricultural cooperatives.
    The workers’ methods of reconciliation were often misunderstood in the
    atmosphere of fear and mistrust engendered by the war. They persistently
    refused to support either armed party and believed that both sides were but
    the reflection of one reality, and the true enemies were not people, but
    ideology, hatred, and ignorance. Their stance threatened those engaged in the
    conflict, and in the first years of the School, a series of attacks were carried
    out against the students. Several were kidnapped and murdered. As the war
    dragged on, even after the Paris Peace Accords were signed in 1973, it
    seemed at times impossible not to succumb to exhaustion and bitterness.
    Continuing to work in a spirit of love and understanding required great
    courage.
    From exile in France, Thich Nhat Hanh wrote to Brother Quang to
    encourage the workers during this dark time. Thay Nhat Hanh (“Thay,” theform of address for Vietnamese monks, means “teacher”) wished to remind
    them of the essential discipline of following one’s breath to nourish and
    maintain calm mindfulness, even in the midst of the most difficult
    circumstances. Because Brother Quang and the students were his colleagues
    and friends, the spirit of this long letter that became The Miracle of
    Mindfulness is personal and direct. When Thay speaks here of village paths,
    he speaks of paths he had actually walked with Brother Quang. When he
    mentions the bright eyes of a young child, he mentions the name of Brother
    Quang’s own son.
    I was living as an American volunteer with the Vietnamese Buddhist
    Peace Delegation in Paris when Thay was writing the letter. Thay headed the
    delegation, which served as an overseas liaison office for the peace and
    reconstruction efforts of the Vietnamese Buddhists, including the School of
    Youth for Social Service. I remember late evenings over tea, when Thay
    explained sections of the letter to delegation members and a few close
    friends. Quite naturally, we began to think of other people in other countries
    who might also benefit from the practices described in the book.
    Thay had recently become acquainted with young Buddhists in Thailand
    who had been inspired by the witness of engaged Buddhism in Vietnam. They
    too wished to act in a spirit of awareness and reconciliation to help avert the
    armed conflict erupting in Thailand, and they wanted to know how to work
    without being overcome by anger and discouragement. Several of them spoke
    English, and we discussed translating Brother Quang’s letter. The idea of a
    translation took on a special poignancy when the confiscation of Buddhist
    publishing houses in Vietnam made the project of printing the letter as a small
    book in Vietnam impossible.
    I happily accepted the task of translating the book into English. For
    nearly three years, I had been living with the Vietnamese Buddhist Peace
    Delegation, where day and night I was immersed in the lyrical sound of the
    Vietnamese language. Thay had been my “formal” Vietnamese teacher; we
    had slowly read through some of his earlier books, sentence by sentence. I
    had thus acquired a rather unusual vocabulary of Vietnamese Buddhist terms.
    Thay, of course, had been teaching me far more than language during those
    three years. His presence was a constant gentle reminder to return to one’s
    true self, to be awake by being mindful.As I sat down to translate The Miracle of Mindfulness, I remembered
    the episodes during the past years that had nurtured my own practice of
    mindfulness. There was the time I was cooking furiously and could not find a
    spoon I’d set down amid a scattered pile of pans and ingredients. As I
    searched here and there, Thay entered the kitchen and smiled. He asked,
    “What is Mobi looking for?” Of course, I answered, “The spoon! I’m looking
    for a spoon!” Thay answered, again with a smile, “No, Mobi is looking for
    Mobi.”
    Thay suggested I do the translation slowly and steadily, in order to
    maintain mindfulness. I translated only two pages a day. In the evenings, Thay
    and I went over those pages, changing and correcting words and sentences.
    Other friends provided editorial assistance. It is difficult to describe the
    actual experience of translating his words, but my awareness of the feel of
    pen and paper, awareness of the position of my body and of my breath
    enabled me to see most clearly the mindfulness with which Thay had written
    each word. As I watched my breath, I could see Brother Quang and the
    workers of the School of Youth for Social Service. More than that, I began to
    see that the words held the same personal and lively directness for any
    reader because they had been written in mindfulness and lovingly directed to
    real people. As I continued to translate, I could see an expanding community
    —the School’s workers, the young Thai Buddhists, and many other friends
    throughout the world.
    When the translation was completed we typed it, and Thay printed a
    hundred copies on the tiny offset machine squeezed into the delegation’s
    bathroom. Mindfully addressing each copy to friends in many countries was a
    happy task for delegation members.
    Since then, like ripples in a pond, The Miracle of Mindfulness has
    traveled far. It has been translated into several other languages and has been
    printed or distributed on every continent in the world. One of the joys of
    being the translator has been to hear from many people who have discovered
    the book. I once met someone in a bookstore who knew a student who had
    taken a copy to friends in the Soviet Union. And recently, I met a young Iraqi
    student in danger of being deported to his homeland, where he faces death for
    his refusal to fight in a war he believes cruel and senseless; he and his
    mother have both read The Miracle of Mindfulness and are practicing
    awareness of the breath. I have learned, too, that proceeds from thePortuguese edition are being used to assist poor children in Brazil. Prisoners,
    refugees, health-care workers, educators, and artists are among those whose
    lives have been touched by this little book. I often think of The Miracle of
    Mindfulness as something of a miracle itself, a vehicle that continues to
    connect lives throughout the world.
    American Buddhists have been impressed by the natural and unique
    blending of Theravada and Mahayana traditions, characteristic of Vietnamese
    Buddhism, which the book expresses. As a book on the Buddhist path, The
    Miracle of Mindfulness is special because its clear and simple emphasis on
    basic practice enables any reader to begin a practice of his or her own
    immediately. Interest in the book, however, is not limited to Buddhists. It has
    found a home with people of many different religious traditions. One’s
    breath, after all, is hardly attached to any particular creed.
    Those who enjoy this book will likely be interested in other books by
    Thich Nhat Hanh which have been translated into English. His books in
    Vietnamese, including short stories, novels, essays, historical treatises on
    Buddhism and poetry, number in the dozens. While several of his earlier
    books in English are no longer in print, more recent works available in
    translation include A Guide to Walking Meditation, Being Peace, and The
    Sun My Heart.
    Denied permission to return to Vietnam, Thich Nhat Hanh spends most
    of the year living in Plum Village, a community he helped found in France.
    There, under the guidance of the same Brother Quang to whom The Miracle
    of Mindfulness was originally addressed years ago, community members
    tend hundreds of plum trees. Profits from the sales of their fruit are used to
    assist hungry children in Vietnam. In addition, Plum Village is open every
    summer to visitors from around the world who wish to spend a month of
    mindfulness and meditation. In recent years, Thich Nhat Hanh has also made
    annual visits to the United States and Canada to conduct week-long retreats
    organized by the Buddhist Peace Fellowship.
    I would like to express special gratitude to Beacon Press for having the
    vision to print this new edition of The Miracle of Mindfulness. I hope that
    each new person whom it reaches will sense that the book is addressed as
    personally to him or her as it was to Brother Quang and the workers of the
    School of Youth for Social Service.Mobi Ho
    August 1987The Miracle of
    MindfulnessOne
    The Essential Discipline
    Yesterday Allen came over to visit with his son Joey. Joey has grown so
    quickly! He’s already seven years old and is fluent in French and English. He
    even uses a bit of slang he’s picked up on the street. Raising children here is
    very different from the way we raise children at home. Here parents believe
    that “freedom is necessary for a child’s development.” During the two hours
    that Allen and I were talking, Allen had to keep a constant eye on Joey. Joey
    played, chattered away, and interrupted us, making it impossible to carry on a
    real conversation. I gave him several picture books for children but he barely
    glanced at them before tossing them aside and interrupting our conversation
    again. He demands the constant attention of grown-ups.
    Later, Joey put on his jacket and went outside to play with a neighbor’s
    child. I asked Allen, “Do you find family life easy?” Allen didn’t answer
    directly. He said that during the past few weeks, since the birth of Ana, he
    had been unable to sleep any length of time. During the night, Sue wakes him
    up and—because she is too tired herself—asks him to check to make sure
    Ana is still breathing. “I get up and look at the baby and then come back and
    fall asleep again. Sometimes the ritual happens two or three times a night.”
    “Is family life easier than being a bachelor?” I asked. Allen didn’t
    answer directly. But I understood. I asked another question: “A lot of peoplesay that if you have a family you’re less lonely and have more security. Is that
    true?” Allen nodded his head and mumbled something softly. But I
    understood.
    Then Allen said, “I’ve discovered a way to have a lot more time. In the
    past, I used to look at my time as if it were divided into several parts. One
    part I reserved for Joey, another part was for Sue, another part to help with
    Ana, another part for household work. The time left over I considered my
    own. I could read, write, do research, go for walks.
    “But now I try not to divide time into parts anymore. I consider my time
    with Joey and Sue as my own time. When I help Joey with his homework, I
    try to find ways of seeing his time as my own time. I go through his lesson
    with him, sharing his presence and finding ways to be interested in what we
    do during that time. The time for him becomes my own time. The same with
    Sue. The remarkable thing is that now I have unlimited time for myself!”
    Allen smiled as he spoke. I was surprised. I knew that Allen hadn’t
    learned this from reading any books. This was something he had discovered
    for himself in his own daily life.
    Washing the dishes to wash the dishes
    Thirty years ago, when I was still a novice at Tu Hieu Pagoda, washing
    the dishes was hardly a pleasant task. During the Season of Retreat when all
    the monks returned to the monastery, two novices had to do all the cooking
    and wash the dishes for sometimes well over one hundred monks. There was
    no soap. We had only ashes, rice husks, and coconut husks, and that was all.
    Cleaning such a high stack of bowls was a chore, especially during the
    winter when the water was freezing cold. Then you had to heat up a big pot
    of water before you could do any scrubbing. Nowadays one stands in a
    kitchen equipped with liquid soap, special scrubpads, and even running hot
    water which makes it all the more agreeable. It is easier to enjoy washing the
    dishes now. Anyone can wash them in a hurry, then sit down and enjoy a cup
    of tea afterwards. I can see a machine for washing clothes, although I wash
    my own things out by hand, but a dishwashing machine is going just a little
    too far!
    While washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes, which
    means that while washing the dishes one should be completely aware of thefact that one is washing the dishes. At first glance, that might seem a little
    silly: why put so much stress on a simple thing? But that’s precisely the point.
    The fact that I am standing there and washing these bowls is a wondrous
    reality. I’m being completely myself, following my breath, conscious of my
    presence, and conscious of my thoughts and actions. There’s no way I can be
    tossed around mindlessly like a bottle slapped here and there on the waves.
    The cup in your hands
    In the United States, I have a close friend named Jim Forest. When I first
    met him eight years ago, he was working with the Catholic Peace
    Fellowship. Last winter, Jim came to visit. I usually wash the dishes after
    we’ve finished the evening meal, before sitting down and drinking tea with
    everyone else. One night, Jim asked if he might do the dishes. I said, “Go
    ahead, but if you wash the dishes you must know the way to wash them.” Jim
    replied, “Come on, you think I don’t know how to wash the dishes?” I
    answered, “There are two ways to wash the dishes. The first is to wash the
    dishes in order to have clean dishes and the second is to wash the dishes in
    order to wash the dishes.” Jim was delighted and said, “I choose the second
    way—to wash the dishes to wash the dishes.” From then on, Jim knew how
    to wash the dishes. I transferred the “responsibility” to him for an entire
    week.
    If while washing dishes, we think only of the cup of tea that awaits us,
    thus hurrying to get the dishes out of the way as if they were a nuisance, then
    we are not “washing the dishes to wash the dishes.” What’s more, we are not
    alive during the time we are washing the dishes. In fact we are completely
    incapable of realizing the miracle of life while standing at the sink. If we
    can’t wash the dishes, the chances are we won’t be able to drink our tea
    either. While drinking the cup of tea, we will only be thinking of other things,
    barely aware of the cup in our hands. Thus we are sucked away into the
    future—and we are incapable of actually living one minute of life.
    Eating a tangerine
    I remember a number of years ago, when Jim and I were first traveling
    together in the United States, we sat under a tree and shared a tangerine. Hebegan to talk about what we would be doing in the future. Whenever we
    thought about a project that seemed attractive or inspiring, Jim became so
    immersed in it that he literally forgot about what he was doing in the present.
    He popped a section of tangerine in his mouth and, before he had begun
    chewing it, had another slice ready to pop into his mouth again. He was
    hardly aware he was eating a tangerine. All I had to say was, “You ought to
    eat the tangerine section you’ve already taken.” Jim was startled into
    realizing what he was doing.
    It was as if he hadn’t been eating the tangerine at all. If he had been
    eating anything, he was “eating” his future plans.
    A tangerine has sections. If you can eat just one section, you can
    probably eat the entire tangerine. But if you can’t eat a single section, you
    cannot eat the tangerine. Jim understood. He slowly put his hand down and
    focused on the presence of the slice already in his mouth. He chewed it
    thoughtfully before reaching down and taking another section.
    Later, when Jim went to prison for activities against the war, I was
    worried about whether he could endure the four walls of prison and sent him
    a very short letter: “Do you remember the tangerine we shared when we
    were together? Your being there is like the tangerine. Eat it and be one with
    it. Tomorrow it will be no more.”
    The Essential Discipline
    More than thirty years ago, when I first entered the monastery, the monks
    gave me a small book called “The Essential Discipline for Daily Use,”
    written by the Buddhist monk Doc The from Bao Son pagoda, and they told
    me to memorize it. It was a thin book. It couldn’t have been more than 40
    pages, but it contained all the thoughts Doc The used to awaken his mind
    while doing any task. When he woke up in the morning, his first thought was,
    “Just awakened, I hope that every person will attain great awareness and see
    in complete clarity.” When he washed his hands, he used this thought to place
    himself in mindfulness: “Washing my hands, I hope that every person will
    have pure hands to receive reality.” The book is comprised entirely of such
    sentences. Their goal was to help the beginning practitioner take hold of his
    own consciousness. The Zen Master Doc The helped all of us young novices
    to practice, in a relatively easy way, those things which are taught in theSutra of Mindfulness. Each time you put on your robe, washed the dishes,
    went to the bathroom, folded your mat, carried buckets of water, or brushed
    your teeth, you could use one of the thoughts from the book in order to take
    hold of your own consciousness.
    The Sutra of Mindfulness* says, “When walking, the practitioner must
    be conscious that he is walking. When sitting, the practitioner must be
    conscious that he is sitting. When lying down, the practitioner must be
    conscious that he is lying down. … No matter what position one’s body is in,
    the practitioner must be conscious of that position. Practicing thus, the
    practitioner lives in direct and constant mindfulness of the body …” The
    mindfulness of the positions of one’s body is not enough, however. We must
    be conscious of each breath, each movement, every thought and feeling,
    everything which has any relation to ourselves.
    But what is the purpose of the Sutra’s instruction? Where are we to find
    the time to practice such mindfulness? If you spend all day practicing
    mindfulness, how will there ever be enough time to do all the work that
    needs to be done to change and to build an alternative society? How does
    Allen manage to work, study Joey’s lesson, take Ana’s diapers to the
    laundromat, and practice mindfulness at the same time?*In the Sutras, Buddha usually teaches that one should use one’s breath in order to achieve
    Concentration. The Sutra which speaks about the use of your breath to maintain mindfulness is
    the Anapanasati Sutra. This Sutra was translated and commentated on by a Vietnamese Zen
    Master of Central Asian origin named Khuong Tang Hoi, around the beginning of the Third
    Century A.D. Anapana means breath and sati means mindfulness. Tang Hoi translated it as
    “Guarding the Mind.” The Anapanasati Sutra, that is, is the sutra on using one’s breath to
    maintain mindfulness. The Sutra on Breath to Maintain Mindfulness is the 118th Sutra in the
    Majhima Nikaya collection of sutras and it teaches 16 methods of using one’s breath.Two
    The Miracle Is
    to Walk on Earth
    Allen said that since he’s begun to consider Joey’s and Sue’s time as his
    own, he has “unlimited time.” But perhaps he has it only in principle.
    Because there are doubtless times when Allen forgets to consider Joey’s time
    as his own time while going over Joey’s homework with him, and thus Allen
    may lose that time. Allen might hope for the time to pass quickly, or he may
    grow impatient because that time seems wasted to him, because it isn’t his
    own time. And so, if he really wants “unlimited time,” he will have to keep
    alive the realization that “this is my time” throughout the time he’s studying
    with Joey. But during such times, one’s mind is inevitably distracted by other
    thoughts, and so if one really wants to keep one’s consciousness alive (from
    now on I’ll use the term “mindfulness” to refer to keeping one’s
    consciousness alive to the present reality), then one must practice right now
    in one’s daily life, not only during meditation sessions.
    When you are walking along a path leading into a village, you can
    practice mindfulness. Walking along a dirt path, surrounded by patches of
    green grass, if you practice mindfulness you will experience that path, the
    path leading into the village. You practice by keeping this one thought alive:“I’m walking along the path leading into the village.” Whether it’s sunny or
    rainy, whether the path is dry or wet, you keep that one thought, but not just
    repeating it like a machine, over and over again. Machine thinking is the
    opposite of mindfulness. If we’re really engaged in mindfulness while
    walking along the path to the village, then we will consider the act of each
    step we take as an infinite wonder, and a joy will open our hearts like a
    flower, enabling us to enter the world of reality.
    I like to walk alone on country paths, rice plants and wild grasses on
    both sides, putting each foot down on the earth in mindfulness, knowing that I
    walk on the wondrous earth. In such moments, existence is a miraculous and
    mysterious reality. People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a
    miracle. But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin
    air, but to walk on earth. Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we
    don’t even recognize: a blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black,
    curious eyes of a child—our own two eyes. All is a miracle.
    Sitting
    Zen Master Doc The says that when sitting in meditation, one should sit
    upright, giving birth to this thought, “Sitting here is like sitting on the Bodhi
    spot.” The Bodhi spot is where Lord Buddha sat when he obtained
    Enlightenment. If any person can become a Buddha, and the Buddhas are all
    those countless persons who have obtained enlightenment, then many have sat
    on the very spot I sit on now. Sitting on the same spot as a Buddha gives rise
    to happiness and sitting in mindfulness means itself to have become a
    Buddha. The poet Nguyen Cong Tru experienced the same thing when he sat
    down on a certain spot, and suddenly saw how others had sat on the same
    spot countless ages ago, and how in ages to come others would also come to
    sit there:
    On the same spot I sit today
    Others came, in ages past, to sit.
    One thousand years, still others will come.
    Who is the singer, and who the listener?
    That spot and the minutes he spent there became a link in eternal reality.But active, concerned people don’t have time to spend leisurely,
    walking along paths of green grass and sitting beneath trees. One must
    prepare projects, consult with the neighbors, try to resolve a million
    difficulties; there is hard work to do. One must deal with every kind of
    hardship, every moment keeping one’s attention focused on the work, alert,
    ready to handle the situation ably and intelligently.
    You might well ask: Then how are we to practice mindfulness?
    My answer is: keep your attention focused on the work, be alert and
    ready to handle ably and intelligently any situation which may arise—this is
    mindfulness. There is no reason why mindfulness should be different from
    focusing all one’s attention on one’s work, to be alert and to be using one’s
    best judgment. During the moment one is consulting, resolving, and dealing
    with whatever arises, a calm heart and self-control are necessary if one is to
    obtain good results. Anyone can see that. If we are not in control of ourselves
    but instead let our impatience or anger interfere, then our work is no longer
    of any value.
    Mindfulness is the miracle by which we master and restore ourselves.
    Consider, for example: a magician who cuts his body into many parts and
    places each part in a different region—hands in the south, arms in the east,
    legs in the north, and then by some miraculous power lets forth a cry which
    reassembles whole every part of his body. Mindfulness is like that—it is the
    miracle which can call back in a flash our dispersed mind and restore it to
    wholeness so that we can live each minute of life.
    Taking hold of one’s breath
    Thus mindfulness is at the same time a means and an end, the seed and
    the fruit. When we practice mindfulness in order to build up concentration,
    mindfulness is a seed. But mindfulness itself is the life of awareness: the
    presence of mindfulness means the presence of life, and therefore
    mindfulness is also the fruit. Mindfulness frees us of forgetfulness and
    dispersion and makes it possible to live fully each minute of life.
    Mindfulness enables us to live.
    You should know how to breathe to maintain mindfulness, as breathing
    is a natural and extremely effective tool which can prevent dispersion.
    Breath is the bridge which connects life to consciousness, which unites yourbody to your thoughts. Whenever your mind becomes scattered, use your
    breath as the means to take hold of your mind again.
    Breathe in lightly a fairly long breath, conscious of the fact that you are
    inhaling a deep breath. Now breathe out all the breath in your lungs,
    remaining conscious the whole time of the exhalation. The Sutra of
    Mindfulness teaches the method to take hold of one’s breath in the following
    manner: “Be ever mindful you breathe in and mindful you breathe out.
    Breathing in a long breath, you know, ‘I am breathing in a long breath.’
    Breathing out a long breath, you know, ‘I am breathing out a long breath.’
    Breathing in a short breath, you know, ‘I am breathing in a short breath.’
    Breathing out a short breath, you know, ‘I am breathing out a short breath.’ ”
    “Experiencing a whole breath-body, I shall breathe in,” thus you train
    yourself. “Experiencing the whole breath-body, I shall breathe out,” thus you
    train yourself. “Calming the activity of the breath-body, I shall breathe in,”
    thus you train yourself. “Calming the activity of the breath-body, I shall
    breathe out,” thus you train yourself.
    In a Buddhist monastery, everyone learns to use breath as a tool to stop
    mental dispersion and to build up concentration power. Concentration power
    is the strength which comes from practicing mindfulness. It is the
    concentration which can help one obtain the Great Awakening. When a
    worker takes hold of his own breath, he has already become awakened. In
    order to maintain mindfulness throughout a long period, we must continue to
    watch our breath.
    It is autumn here and the golden leaves falling one by one are truly
    beautiful. Taking a 10-minute walk in the woods, watching my breath and
    maintaining mindfulness, I feel refreshed and restored. Like that, I can really
    enter into a communion with each leaf.
    Of course, walking alone on a country path, it is easier to maintain
    mindfulness. If there’s a friend by your side, not talking but also watching his
    breath, then you can continue to maintain mindfulness without difficulty. But
    if the friend at your side begins to talk, it becomes a little more difficult.
    If, in your mind, you think, “I wish this fellow would quit talking, so I
    could concentrate,” you have already lost your mindfulness. But if you think,
    instead, “If he wishes to talk, I will answer, but I will continue inmindfulness, aware of the fact that we are walking along this path together,
    aware of what we say, I can continue to watch my breath as well.”
    If you can give rise to that thought, you will be continuing in
    mindfulness. It is harder to practice in such situations than when you are
    alone, but if you continue to practice nonetheless, you will develop the
    ability to maintain much greater concentration. There is a line from a
    Vietnamese folk song that says: “Hardest of all is to practice the Way at
    home, second in the crowd, and third in the pagoda.” It is only in an active
    and demanding situation that mindfulness really becomes a challenge!
    Counting one’s breath and following one’s breath
    In the meditation sessions I recently began for non-Vietnamese, I usually
    suggest various methods that I myself have tried, methods that are quite
    simple. I suggest to beginners the method of “Following the length of the
    breath.” The student lies, back down, on the floor. Then I invite all of the
    participants to gather around so I can show them a few simple points:
    1) Although inhaling and exhaling are the work of the lungs, and take
    place in the chest area, the stomach area also plays a role. The
    stomach rises with the filling of the lungs. At the beginning of the
    breath the stomach begins to push out. But after inhaling about two-
    thirds of the breath, it starts to lower again.
    2) Why? Between your chest and stomach there is a muscular membrane,
    the diaphragm. When you breathe in correctly the air fills the lower
    part of the lungs first, before the upper lungs fill with air, the
    diaphragm pushes down on the stomach, causing the stomach to rise.
    When you have filled your upper lungs with air, the chest pushes out
    and causes the stomach to lower again.
    3) That is why, in former times, people spoke of the breath as
    originating at the navel and terminating at the nostrils.
    For beginners, lying down to practice breathing is very helpful. The
    important thing is to guard against making too much of an effort: too great aneffort can be dangerous for the lungs, especially when the lungs are weak
    from many years of incorrect breathing. In the beginning, the practitioner
    should lie on his or her back on a thin mat or blanket, the two arms loosely at
    the sides. Don’t prop your head on a pillow. Focus your attention on your
    exhalation and watch how long it is. Measure it slowly by counting in your
    mind: 1, 2, 3 … After several times, you will know the “length” of your
    breath: Perhaps it is 5. Now try to extend the exhalation for one more count
    (or 2) so that the exhalation’s length becomes 6 or 7. Begin to exhale
    counting from 1 to 5. When you reach 5, rather than immediately inhaling as
    before, try to extend the exhalation to 6 or 7. This way you will empty your
    lungs of more air. When you have finished exhaling, pause for an instant to let
    your lungs take in fresh air on their own. Let them take in just as much air as
    they want without making any effort. The inhalation will normally be
    “shorter” than the exhalation. Keep a steady count in your mind to measure
    the length of both. Practice several weeks like this, remaining mindful of all
    your exhalations and inhalations while lying down. (If you have a clock with
    a loud tick you can use it to help you keep track of the length of your
    inhalation and exhalation.)
    Continue to measure your breath while walking, sitting, standing, and
    especially whenever you are outdoors. While walking, you might use your
    steps to measure your breath. After a month or so, the difference between the
    length of your exhalation and inhalation will lessen, gradually evening out
    until they are of equal measure. If the length of your exhalation is 6, the
    inhalation will also be 6.
    If you feel at all tired while practicing, stop at once. But even if you do
    not feel tired, don’t prolong the practice of long, equal breaths beyond short
    periods of time—10 to 20 breaths are enough. The moment you feel the least
    fatigue, return your breathing to normal. Fatigue is an excellent mechanism of
    our bodies and the best advisor as to whether one should rest or continue. In
    order to measure your breath you can count—or use a rhythmic phrase that
    you like. (If the length of your breath is 6, you might use instead of numbers,
    the six words, “My heart is now at peace.” If the length is 7 you might use, “I
    walk on the new green earth.” A Buddhist might say, “I take refuge in the
    Buddha.” For a Christian it could be “Our Father who art in heaven.” When
    you are walking, each step should correspond to one word.Quiet breathing
    Your breath should be light, even, and flowing, like a thin stream of
    water running through the sand. Your breath should be very quiet, so quiet
    that a person sitting next to you cannot hear it. Your breathing should flow
    gracefully, like a river, like a watersnake crossing the water, and not like a
    chain of rugged mountains or the gallop of a horse. To master our breath is to
    be in control of our bodies and minds. Each time we find ourselves
    dispersed and find it difficult to gain control of ourselves by different means,
    the method of watching the breath should always be used.
    The instant you sit down to meditate, begin watching your breath. At
    first breathe normally, gradually letting your breathing slow down until it is
    quiet, even, and the lengths of the breaths are fairly long. From the moment
    you sit down to the moment your breathing has become deep and silent, be
    conscious of everything that is happening in yourself.
    As the Buddhist Sutra of Mindfulness says: “Breathing in a long breath,
    you know, ‘I am breathing in a long breath.’ Breathing out a long breath, the
    practitioner knows, ‘I am breathing out a long breath.’ Breathing in a short
    breath, you know, ‘I am breathing in a short breath.’ Breathing out a short
    breath, you know, ‘I am breathing out a short breath.’ Experiencing the whole
    breath-body, I shall breathe in.” Thus you train yourself. “Experiencing the
    whole breath-body, I shall breathe out.” Thus you train yourself. “Calming
    the activity of the breath-body, Ishall breathe in.” Thus you train yourself.
    “Calming the activity of the breath-body, I shall breathe out.” Thus you train
    yourself.
    After about 10 to 20 minutes, your thoughts will have quieted down like
    a pond on which not even a ripple stirs.
    Counting your breath
    Making your breath calm and even is called the method of following
    one’s breath. If it seems hard at first, you can substitute the method of
    counting your breath. As you breathe in, count 1 in your mind, and as you
    breathe out, count 1. Breathe in, count 2. Breathe out, count 2. Continue
    through 10, then return to 1 again. This counting is like a string which
    attaches your mindfulness to your breath. This exercise is the beginning pointin the process of becoming continuously conscious of your breath. Without
    mindfulness, however, you will quickly lose count. When the count is lost,
    simply return to 1 and keep trying until you can keep the count correctly.
    Once you can truly focus your attention on the counts, you have reached the
    point at which you can begin to abandon the counting method and begin to
    concentrate solely on the breath itself.
    In those moments when you are upset or dispersed and find it difficult to
    practice mindfulness, return to your breath: Taking hold of your breath is
    itself mindfulness. Your breath is the wondrous method of taking hold of your
    consciousness. As one religious community says in its rule, “One should not
    lose oneself in mind-dispersion or in one’s surroundings. Learn to practice
    breathing in order to regain control of body and mind, to practice
    mindfulness, and todevelop concentration and wisdom.”
    Every act is a rite
    Suppose there is a towering wall from the top of which one can see vast
    distances—but there is no apparent means to climb it, only a thin piece of
    thread hanging over the top and coming down both sides. A clever person
    will tie a thicker string onto one end of the thread, walk over to the other side
    of the wall, then pull on the thread bringing the string to the other side. Then
    he will tie the end of the string to a strong rope and pull the rope over. When
    the rope has reached the bottom of one side and is secured on the other side,
    the wall can be easily scaled.
    Our breath is such a fragile piece of thread. But once we know how to
    use it, it can become a wondrous tool to help us surmount situations which
    would otherwise seem hopeless. Our breath is the bridge from our body to
    our mind, the element which reconciles our body and mind and which makes
    possible one-ness of body and mind. Breath is aligned to both body and mind
    and it alone is the tool which can bring them both together, illuminating both
    and bringing both peace and calm.
    Many persons and books discuss the immense benefits that result from
    correct breathing. They report that a person who knows how to breathe is a
    person who knows how to build up endless vitality: breath builds up the
    lungs, strengthens the blood, and revitalizes every organ in the body. Theysay that proper breathing is more important than food. And all of these
    statements are correct.
    Years ago, I was extremely ill. After several years of taking medicine
    and undergoing medical treatment, my condition was unimproved. So I turned
    to the method of breathing and, thanks to that, was able to heal myself.
    Breath is a tool. Breath itself is mindfulness. The use of breath as a tool
    may help one obtain immense benefits, but these cannot be considered as
    ends in themselves. These benefits are only the by-products of the realization
    of mindfulness.
    In my small class in meditation for non-Vietnamese, there are many
    young people. I’ve told them that if each one can meditate an hour each day
    that’s good, but it’s nowhere near enough. You’ve got to practice meditation
    when you walk, stand, lie down, sit, and work, while washing your hands,
    washing the dishes, sweeping the floor, drinking tea, talking to friends, or
    whatever you are doing: “While washing the dishes, you might be thinking
    about the tea afterwards, and so try to get them out of the way as quickly as
    possible in order to sit and drink tea. But that means that you are incapable of
    living during the time you are washing the dishes. When you are washing the
    dishes, washing the dishes must be the most important thing in your life. Just
    as when you’re drinking tea, drinking tea must be the most important thing in
    your life. When you’re using the toilet, let that be the most important thing in
    your life.” And so on. Chopping wood is meditation. Carrying water is
    meditation. Be mindful 24 hours a day, not just during the one hour you may
    allot for formal meditation or reading scripture and reciting prayers. Each act
    must be carried out in mindfulness. Each act is a rite, a ceremony. Raising
    your cup of tea to your mouth is a rite. Does the word “rite” seem too
    solemn? I use that word in order to jolt you into the realization of the life-
    and-death matter of awareness.Three
    A Day of Mindfulness
    Every day and every hour, one should practice mindfulness. That’s easy to
    say, but to carry it out in practice is not. That’s why I suggest to those who
    come to the meditation sessions that each person should try hard to reserve
    one day out of the week to devote entirely to their practice of mindfulness. In
    principle, of course every day should be your day, and every hour your hour.
    But the fact is that very few of us have reached such a point. We have the
    impression that our family, place of work, and society rob us of all our time.
    So I urge that everyone set aside one day each week. Saturday, perhaps.
    If it is Saturday, then Saturday must be entirely your day, a day during
    which you are completely the master. Then Saturday will be the lever that
    will lift you to the habit of practicing mindfulness. Every worker in a peace
    or service community, no matter how urgent its work, has the right to such a
    day, for without it we will lose ourselves quickly in a life full of worry and
    action, and our responses will become increasingly useless. Whatever the
    day chosen, it can be considered as the day of mindfulness.
    To set up a day of mindfulness, figure out a way to remind yourself at the
    moment of waking that this day is your day of mindfulness. You might hang
    something on the ceiling or on the wall, a paper with the word “mindfulness”
    or a pinebranch—anything that will suggest to you as you open your eyes andsee it that today is your day of mindfulness. Today is your day. Remembering
    that, perhaps you can feel a smile which affirms that you are in complete
    mindfulness, a smile that nourishes that perfect mindfulness.
    While still lying in bed, begin slowly to follow your breath—slow,
    long, and conscious breaths. Then slowly rise from bed (instead of turning
    out all at once as usual), nourishing mindfulness by every motion. Once up,
    brush your teeth, wash your face, and do all your morning activities in a calm
    and relaxing way, each movement done in mindfulness. Follow your breath,
    take hold of it, and don’t let your thoughts scatter. Each movement should be
    done calmly. Measure your steps with quiet, long breaths. Maintain a half
    smile.
    Spend at least a half hour taking a bath. Bathe slowly and mindfully, so
    that by the time you have finished, you feel light and refreshed. Afterwards,
    you might do household work such as washing dishes, dusting and wiping off
    the tables, scrubbing the kitchen floor, arranging books on their shelves.
    Whatever the tasks, do them slowly and with ease, in mindfulness. Don’t do
    any task in order to get it over with. Resolve to do each job in a relaxed way,
    with all your attention. Enjoy and be one with your work. Without this, the
    day of mindfulness will be of no value at all. The feeling that any task is a
    nuisance will soon disappear if it is done in mindfulness. Take the example
    of the Zen Masters. No matter what task or motion they undertake, they do it
    slowly and evenly, without reluctance.
    For those who are just beginning to practice, it is best to maintain a
    spirit of silence throughout the day. That doesn’t mean that on the day of
    mindfulness, you shouldn’t speak at all. You can talk, you can even go ahead
    and sing, but if you talk or sing, do it in complete mindfulness of what you
    are saying or singing, and keep talking and singing to a minimum. Naturally, it
    is possible to sing and practice mindfulness at the same time, just as long as
    one is conscious of the fact that one is singing and aware of what one is
    singing. But be warned that it is much easier, when singing or talking, to stray
    from mindfulness if your meditation strength is still weak.
    At lunchtime, prepare a meal for yourself. Cook the meal and wash the
    dishes in mindfulness. In the morning, after you have cleaned and
    straightened up your house, and in the afternoon, after you have worked in the
    garden or watched clouds or gathered flowers, prepare a pot of tea to sit and
    drink in mindfulness. Allow yourself a good length of time to do this. Don’tdrink your tea like someone who gulps down a cup of coffee during a
    workbreak. Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which
    the whole earth revolves—slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.
    Live the actual moment. Only this actual moment is life. Don’t be attached to
    the future. Don’t worry about things you have to do. Don’t think about getting
    up or taking off to do anything. Don’t think about “departing.”
    Be a bud sitting quietly in the hedge
    Be a smile, one part of wondrous existence
    Stand here. There is no need to depart.
    This homeland is as beautiful as the homeland of our childhood
    Do not harm it, please, and continue to sing …
    (“Butterfly Over the Field of Golden Mustard Flowers”)
    In the evening, you might read scripture and copy passages, write letters
    to friends, or do anything else you enjoy outside of your normal duties during
    the week. But whatever you do, do it in mindfulness. Eat only a little for the
    evening meal. Later, around 10 or 11 o’clock, as you sit in meditation, you
    will be able to sit more easily on an empty stomach. Afterwards you might
    take a slow walk in the fresh night air, following your breath in mindfulness
    and measuring the length of your breaths by your steps. Finally, return to your
    room and sleep in mindfulness.
    Somehow we must find a way to allow each worker a day of
    mindfulness. Such a day is crucial. Its effect on the other days of the week is
    immeasurable. Ten years ago, thanks to such a day of mindfulness, Chu Van
    and our other sisters and brothers in the Tiep Hien Order were able to guide
    themselves through many difficult times. After only three months of observing
    such a day of mindfulness once a week, I know that you will see a significant
    change in your life. The day of mindfulness will begin to penetrate the other
    days of the week, enabling you to eventually live seven days a week in
    mindfulness. I’m sure you agree with me on the day of mindfulness’s
    importance!Four
    The Pebble
    Why should you meditate? First of all, because each of us needs to realize
    total rest. Even a night of sleep doesn’t provide total rest. Twisting and
    turning, the facial muscles tense, all the while dreaming—hardly rest! Nor is
    lying down rest when you still feel restless and twist and turn. Lying on your
    back, with your arms and legs straight but not stiff, your head unsupported by
    a pillow—this is a good position to practice breathing and to relax all the
    muscles; but this way it is also easier to fall asleep. You cannot go as far in
    meditation lying down as by sitting. It is possible to find total rest in a sitting
    position, and in turn to advance deeper in meditation in order to resolve the
    worries and troubles that upset and block your consciousness.
    Among our workers in Vietnam there are many who can sit in the lotus
    position, the left foot placed on the right thigh and the right foot placed on the
    left thigh. Others can sit in the half lotus, the left foot placed on the right
    thigh, or the right foot placed on the left thigh. In our meditation class in
    Paris, there are people who do not feel comfortable in either of the above
    two positions and so I have shown them how to sit in the Japanese manner,
    the knees bent, resting on their two legs. By placing a pillow beneath one’s
    feet, it is possible to sit that way for more than an hour and a half. Even so,
    anyone can learn to sit in the half lotus, though at the beginning it may besomewhat painful. But after a few weeks of practice, the position gradually
    becomes quite comfortable. During the initial period, when the pain can be
    bothersome, alternate the position of the legs or change to another sitting
    position. If one sits in the lotus or half-lotus position, it is necessary to use a
    cushion to sit on so that both knees touch the floor. The three points of bodily
    contact with the floor created by this position provide an extremely stable
    position.
    Keep your back straight. This is very important. The neck and head
    should be aligned with the spinal column; they should be straight but not stiff
    or wood-like. Keep your eyes focused a yard or two in front of you. If you
    can, maintain a half smile.
    Now begin to follow your breath and to relax all of your muscles.
    Concentrate on keeping your spinal column straight and on following your
    breath. As for everything else, let it go. Let go of everything. If you want to
    relax the worry-tightened muscles in your face, let the half smile come to
    your face. As the half smile appears, all the facial muscles begin to relax.
    The longer the half smile is maintained, the better. It is the same smile you
    see on the face of the Buddha.
    Place your left hand, palm side up, in your right palm. Let all the
    muscles in your hands, fingers, arms, and legs relax. Let go of everything. Be
    like the waterplants which flow with the current, while beneath the surface of
    the water the riverbed remains motionless. Hold on to nothing but your breath
    and the half smile.
    For beginners, it is better to sit no longer than 20 or 30 minutes. During
    that time, you can readily obtain total rest. The technique for obtaining this
    rest lies in two things—watching and letting go: watching your breath, and
    letting go of everything else. Release every muscle in your body. After about
    15 minutes or so, it is possible to reach a deep quiet filled with inner peace
    and joy. Maintain this quiet and peace.
    Some people look on meditation as a toil and want the time to pass
    quickly in order to rest afterwards. Such persons do not know how to sit yet.
    If you sit correctly, it is possible to find total relaxation and peace right in the
    position of sitting. Often it helps to meditate on the image of a pebble thrown
    into a river.
    How is one helped by the image of the pebble? Sit down in whatever
    position suits you best, the half lotus or lotus, back straight, the half smile onyour face. Breathe slowly and deeply, following each breath, becoming one
    with the breath. Then let go of everything. Imagine yourself as a pebble
    which has been thrown into a river. The pebble sinks through the water
    effortlessly. Detached from everything, it falls by the shortest distance
    possible, finally reaching the bottom, the point of perfect rest. You are like a
    pebble which has let itself fall into the river, letting go of everything. At the
    center of your being is your breath. You don’t need to know the length of time
    it takes before reaching the point of complete rest on the bed of fine sand
    beneath the water. When you feel yourself resting like a pebble which has
    reached the riverbed, that is the point when you begin to find your own rest.
    You are no longer pushed or pulled by anything.
    If you cannot find joy in peace in these very moments of sitting, then the
    future itself will only flow by as a river flows by, you will not be able to
    hold it back, you will be incapable of living the future when it has become
    the present. Joy and peace are the joy and peace possible in this very hour of
    sitting. If you cannot find it here, you won’t find it anywhere. Don’t chase
    after your thoughts as a shadow follows its object. Don’t run after your
    thoughts. Find joy and peace in this very moment.
    This is your own time. This spot where you sit is your own spot. It is on
    this very spot and in this very moment that you can become enlightened. You
    don’t have to sit beneath a special tree in a distant land. Practice like this for
    a few months, and you will begin to know a profound and renewing delight.
    The ease of sitting depends on whether you practice mindfulness a little
    or a lot each day. And it depends on whether or not you sit regularly.
    Whenever possible, join with friends or relatives and organize an hour of
    sitting each night, say from 10 to 11. Whoever wishes could come to sit for a
    half hour, or even an entire hour.
    Mindfulness of the mind
    Someone might well ask: is relaxation then the only goal of meditation?
    In fact the goal of meditation goes much deeper than that. While relaxation is
    the necessary point of departure, once one has realized relaxation, it ispossible to realize a tranquil heart and clear mind. To realize a tranquil heart
    and clear mind is to have gone far along the path of meditation.
