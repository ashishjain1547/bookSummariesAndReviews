<pre> In 1902, the sociologist Charles Horton Cooley wrote: “I am not what I think I am, and I am not what you think I am. I am what I think you think I am.”
Let that blow your mind for a moment.
Our identity is wrapped up in what others think of us—or, more accurately, what we think others think of us.
Not only is our self-image tied up in how we think others see us, but most of our efforts at self-improvement are really just us trying to meet that imagined ideal. If we think someone we admire sees wealth as success, then we chase wealth to impress that person. If we imagine that a friend is judging our looks, we tailor our appearance in response. In West Side Story, Maria meets a boy who's into her.
What's her very next song? “I Feel Pretty.”

<h3>IS THIS DUST OR IS IT ME?</h3>

Gauranga Das offered me a beautiful metaphor to illustrate the external influences that obscure our true selves.

<i>We are in a storeroom, lined with unused books and boxes full of artifacts.
Unlike the rest of the ashram, which is always tidy and well swept, this place is dusty and draped in cobwebs. The senior monk leads me up to a mirror and says, “What can you see?”
Through the thick layer of dust, I can't even see my reﬂection. I say as much, and the monk nods. Then he wipes the arm of his robe across the glass.
A cloud of dust puﬀs into my face, stinging my eyes and ﬁlling my throat. He says, “Your identity is a mirror covered with dust. When you ﬁrst look in the mirror, the truth of who you are and what you value is obscured.
Clearing it may not be pleasant, but only when that dust is gone can you see your true reﬂection.”</i>

This was a practical demonstration of the words of Chaitanya, a sixteenth- century Bengali Hindu saint. Chaitanya called this state of affairs ceto-darpaṇa- mārjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind.
The foundation of virtually all monastic traditions is removing distractions that prevent us from focusing on what matters most—finding meaning in life by mastering physical and mental desires. Some traditions give up speaking, some give up sex, some give up worldly possessions, and some give up all three. In the ashram, we lived with just what we needed and nothing more. I experienced rsthand the enlightenment of letting go. When we are buried in nonessentials, we lose track of what is truly significant. I'm not asking you to give up any of these things, but I want to help you recognize and filter out the noise of external influences. This is how we clear the dust and see if those values truly reflect you.

Guiding values are the principles that are most important to us and that we feel should guide us: who we want to be, how we treat ourselves and others.

Values tend to be single-word concepts like freedom, equality, compassion, honesty. That might sound rather abstract and idealistic, but values are really practical. They're a kind of ethical GPS we can use to navigate through life. If you know your values, you have directions that point you toward the people and actions and habits that are best for you. Just as when we drive through a new area, we wander aimlessly without values; we take wrong turns, we get lost, we're trapped by indecision. Values make it easier for you to surround yourself with the right people, make tough career choices, use your time more wisely, and focus your attention where it matters. Without them we are swept away by distractions.

<h3>WHERE VALUES COME FROM</h3>

Our values don't come to us in our sleep. We don't think them through consciously. Rarely do we even put them into words. But they exist nonetheless.
Everyone is born into a certain set of circumstances, and our values are defined by what we experience. Were we born into hardship or luxury? Where did we receive praise? Parents and caregivers are often our loudest fans and critics. Though we might rebel in our teenage years, we are generally compelled to please and imitate those authority gures. Looking back, think about how your time with your parents was spent. Playing, enjoying conversation, working on projects together? What did they tell you was most important, and did it match what mattered most to them? Who did they want you to be? What did they want you to accomplish? How did they expect you to behave? Did you absorb these ideals, and have they worked for you? From the start, our educations are another powerful influence. The subjects that are taught. The cultural angle from which they are taught. The way we are expected to learn. A fact-driven curriculum doesn't encourage creativity, a narrow cultural approach doesn't foster tolerance for people from different backgrounds and places, and there are few opportunities to immerse ourselves in our passions, even if we know them from an early age. This is not to say that school doesn't prepare us for life—and there are many different educational models out there, some of which are less restrictive—but it is worth taking a step back to consider whether the values you carried from school feel right to you.

<h3>TRY THIS: WHERE DID YOUR VALUES COME FROM?</h3>

It can be hard to perceive the effect these casual inﬂuences have on us. Values are abstract, elusive, and the world we live in constantly pushes blatant and subliminal suggestions as to what we should want, and how we should live, and how we form our ideas of who we are. Write down some of the values that shape your life. Next to each, write the origin. Put a checkmark next to each value that you truly share.

<table> <tr> <td>VALUE</td> <td>ORIGIN</td> <td>IS IT TRUE TO ME?</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>Kindness</td> <td>Parent</td> <td>✓</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>Appearance</td> <td>Media</td> <td>Not in the same way</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>Wealth</td> <td>Parent</td> <td>No</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>Good grades</td> <td>School</td> <td>Interfered with real learning</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>Knowledge</td> <td>School</td> <td>✓</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>Family</td> <td>Tradition</td> <td>Family: yes, but not traditional</td> </tr> </table>

<h3>AUDIT YOUR LIFE</h3>

No matter what you think your values are, your actions tell the real story. What we do with our spare time shows what we value. For instance, you might put spending time with your family at the top of your list of values, but if you spend all your free time playing golf, your actions don't match your values, and you need to do some self-examination.

<b>Time</b>

<b>TRY THIS: AUDIT YOUR TIME</b>

Spend a week tracking how much time you devote to the following: family, friends, health, and self. (Note that we're leaving out sleeping, eating, and working. Work, in all its forms, can sprawl without boundaries. If this is the case for you, then set your own deﬁnition of when you are “oﬃcially” at work and make “extra work” one of your categories.) The areas where you spend the most time should match what you value the most. Say the amount of time that your job requires exceeds how important it is to you. That's a sign that you need to look very closely at that decision. You're deciding to spend time on something that doesn't feel important to you. What are the values behind that decision? Are your earnings from your job ultimately serving your values?

<b>Media</b>

When you did your audit, no doubt a significant amount of your time was spent reading or viewing media. Researchers estimate that, on average, each of us will spend more than eleven years of our lives looking at TV and social media! Perhaps your media choices feel casual, but time reflects values.

<b>Money</b>

Like time, you can look at the money you spend to see the values by which you live. Exclude necessities like home, dependents, car, bills, food, and debt. Now look at your discretionary spending. What was your biggest investment this month? Which discretionary areas are costing you the most? Does your spending correspond to what matters most to you? We often have an odd perspective on what's “worth it” that doesn't quite make sense if you look at all your expenditures at once. I was advising someone who complained that the family was overspending on afterschool classes for the kids… until she realized that she spent more on her shoes than on their music lessons.
Seeing posts on social media that compared spending and our priorities got me thinking about how the ways we spend our time and money reveal what we value.

A 60-minute TV show (“Flew by!”) 

A 60-minute lunch with family (“Will it ever end!”) 

Everyday coffee habit ($4/day, almost $1,500/year) (“Need it!”) 

Fresh healthy food choices (an extra 1.50/day, about $550/year) (“Not worth it!”) 

15 minutes scrolling social media (“Me time!”) 

15 minutes of meditation (“No time!”) 

It's all in how you see it. When you look at a month of expenses, think about whether discretionary purchases were long- or short-term investments—a great dinner out or a dance class? Were they for entertainment or enlightenment, for yourself or someone else? If you have a gym membership, but only went once this month and spent more on wine, you have some rethinking to do.

<h3>CURATE YOUR VALUES</h3>

<b>TRY THIS: PAST VALUES</b>

Reﬂect on the three best and three worst choices you've ever made. Why did you make them? What have you learned? How would you have done it differently?

<b>TRY THIS: VALUE-DRIVEN DECISIONS</b>

For the next week, whenever you spend money on a nonnecessity or make a plan for how you will spend your free time, pause, and think: What is the value behind this choice? It only takes a second, a ﬂash of consideration. Ideally, this momentary pause becomes instinctive, so that you are making conscious choices about what matters to you and how much energy you devote to it.

<b>TRY THIS: COMPANION AUDIT</b> 

Over the course of a week, make a list of the people with whom you spend the most time.
List the values that you share next to each person. Are you giving the most time to the people who align most closely with your values? </pre>
