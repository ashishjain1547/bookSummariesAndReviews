  </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;Cancers of the mind,&quot; referring to comparing, complaining, and criticizing, highlights negative
      thought patterns that can adversely impact one's mental well-being and relationships.</li>
    <li>Comparing: Constantly measuring oneself against others can lead to feelings of inadequacy or superiority.
      Instead of fostering a positive mindset, it can breed jealousy, low self-esteem, and hinder personal growth.
      Embracing individuality and focusing on personal progress can be more beneficial.</li>
    <li>Complaining: Habitual complaining not only reflects a negative outlook but can also create a toxic environment
      for oneself and those around. While it's natural to express concerns, constant complaints without seeking
      solutions can perpetuate a cycle of negativity. Shifting focus towards finding solutions or practicing gratitude
      can be a healthier approach.</li>
    <li>Criticizing: Excessive criticism, whether directed at oneself or others, can erode self-confidence and damage
      relationships. Constructive feedback is valuable, but relentless criticism can be destructive. Cultivating empathy
      and understanding can lead to more positive interactions.</li>
    <li>Addressing these &quot;cancers of the mind&quot; involves cultivating self-awareness, fostering a positive
      mindset, and practicing mindfulness. By consciously choosing to replace comparing with self-acceptance,
      complaining with gratitude, and criticizing with constructive communication, individuals can promote mental
      well-being and build healthier relationships.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    <font color="#333333">NEGATIVITY IS EVERYWHERE (But don’t play a victim)</font>
  </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Bad things do happen. In our lives, we’re all victims at some point—whether we’re being racially profiled or
      being cut off in traffic. But if we adopt a victim mentality, we’re more likely to take on a sense of entitlement
      and to behave selfishly. </li>
    <li>Stanford psychologists took 104 subjects and assigned them to one of two groups—one told to write a short essay
      about a time they were bored, and the other to write about a time when life seemed unfair or when they felt
      “wronged or slighted by someone.” </li>
    <li>Afterward, the participants were asked if they wanted to help the researchers with an easy task. Those who’d
      written about a time they’d been wronged were 26 percent less likely to help the researchers. </li>
    <li>In a similar study, participants who identified with a victim mindset were not only more likely to express
      selfish attitudes afterward, they were also more likely to leave behind trash and even take the experimenters’
      pens!</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    <font color="#333333">NEGATIVITY IS CONTAGIOUS (And Groupthink Bias)</font>
  </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>In the 1950s Solomon Asch gathered groups of college students and told them they were doing a vision test. The
      catch was that in each group, everyone was an actor except one person: the subject of the test. </li>
    <li>Asch showed participants an image of a “target” line first, then of a series of three lines: one shorter, one
      longer, and one that was clearly the same length as the target line. The students were asked which line matched
      the length of the target line. Sometimes the actors gave correct answers, and sometimes they purposefully gave
      incorrect answers. In each case, the real study participant answered last. </li>
    <li>The correct answer should have been obvious. But, influenced by the actors, about 75 percent of the subjects
      followed the crowd to give an incorrect response at least once. This phenomenon has been called groupthink bias.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Groupthink is the practice of thinking or decision-making in a way that discourages individual responsibility.

  <ul>
    <li>Gauranga Das repeated this advice in brief metaphorical form that we often used to remind ourselves not to
      harbor negative thoughts toward others: </li>
    <li>Don’t judge someone with a diﬀerent disease. </li>
    <li>Don’t expect anyone to be perfect. </li>

  </h1>

  <b>(1) Become an Objective Observer</b>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of reacting compulsively and retaliating to negativity or a negative word or action, we could enjoy our
      freedom as human beings and refuse to be upset. </li>
    <li>We step away, not literally but emotionally, and look at the situation as if we are not in the middle of it. We
      will talk more about this distance, which is called detachment, in the next chapter. </li>
    <li>For now, I’ll say that it helps us find understanding without judgment.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
  
  <b>(2) Back Slowly Away</b>
  
  <p>
    <font color="#000000">From a position of understanding, we are better equipped to address negative energy. The
      simplest response is to back slowly away. Just as in the last chapter we let go of the influences that interfered
      with our values, we want to cleanse ourselves of the negative attitudes that cloud our outlook. In The Heart of
      the Buddha’s Teaching, Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk who has been called the Father of Mindfulness, writes,
      “Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to
      anything—anger, anxiety, or possessions—we cannot be free.” I encourage you to purge or avoid physical triggers of
      negative thoughts and feelings, like that sweatshirt your ex gave you or the coffee shop where you always run into
      a former friend. If you don’t let go physically, you won’t let go emotionally.</font>

      dealings with others. Sometimes we have been wounded so deeply that we can’t imagine how we might forgive the
      person who hurt us. But, contrary to what most of us believe, forgiveness is primarily an action we take within
      ourselves. Sometimes it’s better (and safer and healthier) not to have direct contact with the person at all;
      other times, the person who hurt us is no longer around to be forgiven directly. But those factors don’t impede
      forgiveness because it is, first and foremost, internal. It frees you from anger.</font>

  </h1>
  <p>
    <font color="#000000">Forgiveness has to ow in both directions. None of us is perfect, and though there will be
      situations where you are blameless, there are also times when there are missteps on both sides of a conflict. When
      you cause pain and others cause you pain, it’s as if your hearts get twisted together into an uncomfortable knot.
      When we forgive, we start to separate our pain from theirs and to heal ourselves emotionally. But when we ask for
      forgiveness at the same time, we untwist together. This is a bit trickier, because we’re much more comfortable
      finding fault in other people and then forgiving it. We’re not used to admitting fault and taking responsibility
      for what we create in our lives.</font>
