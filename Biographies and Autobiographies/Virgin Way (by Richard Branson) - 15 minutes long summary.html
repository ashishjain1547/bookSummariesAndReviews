        This post is about the book
        “The Virgin Way” by billionaire Richard Branson. In this book, Richard talks
        about values and beliefs he holds dear in regards to leadership.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        The book is filled with amazing witty quotes, and the one
        it starts with is: “Life’s too short. Don’t enjoy it? Don’t do it!”<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Richard explains the last quote using another one that “Life
        is not a dress rehearsal!”. So you should not waste any of your limited time on
        this earth doing stuff that doesn’t lighten your face.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        The book is divided into four parts: Listen, Learn, Laugh
        and Lead.<o:p></o:p>

    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Reading from “Preface”, Richard had dropped out of
        high-school at the age of 16 to start off a magazine called “Student”, simply
        because he wasn’t enjoying his school as he had difficulties learning due to
        dyslexia. But he adds he does not mean to start some kind of ‘burn your books’
        movement!<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        He writes “Having ‘Fun’ is at the core of the ‘Virgin
        Way’. Being passionately engaged and enjoying every minute of what you do is an
        attitudinal thing – a spark – It’s something that’s either in a person’s DNA or
        not, and as such has to come from within.” <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        As any of Richard’s colleagues at Virgin will attest, in
        his vocabulary the phrase ‘seemingly impossible’ is defined as ‘something that
        should be a lot of fun disproving’.<o:p></o:p>

        Richard mentions he didn’t read any of the 93,000 books
        he found on Amazon for the search string “Leadership books” nor does he have
        any idea of what these authors have to say but he doubts that few if any of
        them have had a fraction of the fun that Richard has had in the forty-plus
        years leading the charge with the Virgin group of companies.<o:p></o:p>

    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        This first story is about the “Power of forgiveness and
        giving people a second chance”.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        On an odd occasion Richard had been guilty of helping
        himself to a few pennies that his dad used to keep in his bedroom wardrobe. And
        in his mind, he was only borrowing with no terms or structure for repayment
        established. Richard was using these ill-gotten gains for buying chocolates
        from a sweet shop just around the corner from his house.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        One day, though, he’d taken a much bigger ‘loan’ than
        usual from his dad’s wardrobe bank and promptly done his part to boost
        Cadbury’s shareholder value. The old lady in the sweet shop smelled the rat,
        she did not say anything to Richard but next time when he was there with his
        father, she blurted out “Now I don’t want to get him into any trouble, Mr.
        Branson, but I don’t know where young Richard’s getting all his money from. I
        hope he isn’t stealing it.”<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        But then, just as Richard was thinking, ‘Oops, I’m really
        in for it now!’ his dad staggered him by putting his nose right up to hers,
        looking her straight in the eyes and loudly declaring, ‘Madam, how dare you
        accuse my son of stealing?’ Richard was even more surprised when, after they’d
        marched out of the shop, his dad never said another word about it. Sometimes,
        though, the power of the unspoken word can be a frighteningly powerful thing
        and his father’s studied silence with him for the rest of that day spoke
        volumes. In addition, the fact that he’d immediately jumped in and vehemently
        defended his light-fingered son’s integrity made Richard feel more guilt-ridden
        and miserable than if he had berated him in front of her. Dad’s handling of the
        situation taught Richard a hugely effective lesson. Not only did he never pinch
        another penny from his parents, but it also taught him a life-lesson on the
        power of forgiveness and giving people a second chance. <o:p></o:p>

    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Richard attributes his success a whole lot on his
        listening skills, about which he writes that he learned in school that “Listen”
        and “Silent” were anagrams and to make a list out of it, he added the word
        “Enlist”. Now using these words in a sentence he quotes “<b><i>if more of us
                could ‘enlist’ the art of remaining ‘silent’ in order to ‘listen’ we would dramatically
                improve our ability to learn”. <o:p></o:p></i></b></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Next, lesson is titled “Mirror-mirror” that tells you the
        importance of taking customer feedback.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        The saying that he starts with is ‘If it walks like a
        duck – it usually <i>is </i>a duck”, which means that if the customers are
        getting a perception of what you are doing to resemble a duck and then it
        usually is a duck. You should make it a habit seeing your actions from the eyes
        of the people at the receiving end of it.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        To this Richard adds “Now I am not suggesting that
        soliciting the input of foreign dictators is necessarily the way to go, but
        when you have family and friends who are also consumers, it is downright
        foolish not to take full advantage and listen to their outside-in points of
        view.”<o:p></o:p>

    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Trusting the consumer instincts is a tried and true
        belief so much so that people make their investment decisions based on it. If
        you like a product and all your neighbors like it too then the chances are that
        this product is going to last and hence is a good investment.<o:p></o:p>

    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        The ultimate example of such consumer behavior is the
        tale of American Entrepreneur Victor Kiam and his company Remington Products.
        As the story goes, his wife bought him a Remington electric razor and, as he
        famously said in their advertising campaigns, ‘I liked the product so much, I
        bought the company.’<o:p></o:p>

        The strange fact is that nervousness is good. The best
        and most experienced public speakers still get nervous, so don’t fret about it.
        A touch of the jitters sharpens the mind, gets the adrenalin flowing and helps
        you to focus. The best way to mitigate it is quite simple, practice, practice,
        practice and practice some more. Go through it until you are saying it in your

        On “Navigating the Next”:<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        This was in 1975. Kodak had developed a digital camera
        that was one of its kind. But the product was soon dropped for the fear that it
        would threaten their existing photographic film business. Instead of embracing
        the opportunities that the new technology presented and exploiting their
        resources to lead the charge, Kodak’s senior management instead seemed to bury
        their heads in the sand as if by ignoring the digital, they would magically
        make it go away.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Eventually, seeing the error, Kodak went on to create something
        called ‘Photo CD’ that fell somewhere between their traditional analogue
        offerings and digital technology, but compromises seldom work. <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        While Kodak tried desperately to hang on to the past and
        the huge 70 per cent profit margins they enjoyed, newcomers to the camera game
        like Sony came and ‘ate their lunch’. Kodak’s share price dropped by 80 per
        cent in 2011 and they filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        The fact that other major analogue-era imaging companies
        like Canon and Nikon all successfully navigated the transition to digital would
        seem to indicate that the only plausible reason for Kodak’s rapid decline was a
        catastrophic failure in leadership. And as is almost always the case, leaders
        who spend too much time looking in the rear-view mirror are seldom positioned
        to navigate the road ahead.<o:p></o:p>

        Next story is about “Luck”.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        The first part of the story is about Google. When Antonio
        and Sergey (one of the Google’s founders) were refused a ticket at a theater
        due to houseful, the two went for coffee and Sergey told Antonio about the
        search engine that he was working on. Antonio did not understand the
        technicalities of the project but he liked the idea of organizing vast amount
        of information on the web. In short, it struck him as an idea that had a lot of
        market potential. When Antonio met up with his new friend the next day,
        therefore, he asked how he could get involved. He was told they were in the
        early stages of raising capital to launch their business, that it was valued at
        a million dollars and they’d love to have him as an investor. In what was to
        become the watershed moment of his life, Antonio responded by saying, ‘Well, I
        have $10,000 that was earmarked for a second-hand car but I might consider
        putting it into your company instead. What would that get me?’ He was told it
        would give him a one per cent ownership stake and so they agreed that they had
        a deal. <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        ***<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        A counterpoint to Antonio’s story is that of Ronald
        Wayne. Wayne had worked alongside Steve Jobs at Atari and became one of the
        co-founders of Apple with Jobs and Wozniak. At forty years of age, Wayne was
        almost twice as old as his young co-founders and so he agreed to essentially
        act as the venture’s ‘adult supervisor’ in return for which he was given a ten
        per cent stake in the nascent company. Among other things Wayne drew up the
        partnership agreement between the three, drafted the first company logo and
        wrote the Apple 1 manual. For a variety of reasons, however, Wayne just didn’t
        feel that things were going to work out, and also didn’t particularly enjoy
        working with Jobs, so after only a couple of months Wayne called it quit and
        relinquished his stock in the company for a one-time pay-out of $800. Had he
        toughed it out and hung in there, that stock would today have been worth close
        to fifty billion dollars! So was it bad luck or bad judgement? Maybe a bit of
        both. But Antonio was no Ronald Wayne and had been astute enough never to sell
        a single Google share. He never got the used car but that $10,000 is now worth
        billions of dollars. In terms of making the luck work for him, Antonio had to
        have the smarts to recognize an opportunity when it came along and greater
        still the guts to risk his $10,000.<o:p></o:p>

        This is usually achieved with such no-brainers as deep discounting, leveraging
        their distribution clout or what can best be described as simple bully tactics.

        But when someone arrives on the scene with a hybrid
        product that they cannot pigeonhole – as was the case with the biblical David’s
        slingshot – it can cause massive confusion in the enemy’s ranks. When all else
        is equal then the big guys will usually find a way to outmuscle any pesky
        upstart, so that is why the newcomer has got to make sure that the playing
        field is anything but level. You always know it’s working when they cry foul!<o:p></o:p>

        The story I am going to tell is about the greatest
        innovator who has ever lived – Leonardo da Vinci. This dates back to the 1500s.
        Da Vinci was called in from Italy to Constantinople to work on building a
        bridge that was going to be an unprecedented feat of engineering, a single-span
        240-metre-long bridge. <o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        Excited by the challenge, da Vinci set to work and the
        dramatic result was an incredibly futuristic bridge design that with the use of
        unheard geometric concepts produced a soaring single-span bridge that was truly
        a work of art.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        The engineering and architectural experts of the day were
        appalled and condemned it as an abomination and a work of fantasy that could
        never possibly work.<o:p></o:p>
    </div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        As everyone knows, obtaining planning approvals in a city
        can be a long and frustrating task, but in da Vinci’s case 500 years is pushing
        the envelope! Setting new standards in ‘better late than never’, Leonardo’s
        sixteenth-century bridge design (with a few updates based on
        twenty-first-century building materials) was finally given the go-ahead in 2012
        by the city of Istanbul. But history is littered with da Vinci-like tales of
        how the greatest innovators of their times have had to struggle to get their
        ideas past the power of incumbents who can only accept those things that fit
        into their existing pigeonholes, and the established theory.<o:p></o:p>

        Next, we tell the story of Sara Blakely. Sara had been
        wearing tights with the legs cut off but always had problems with them riding
        up her leg. So she started looking into how she could make a shaper that
        worked. The birth of Spanx was a classic entrepreneurial case study where if
        you can’t find something you want, then go out and create it.<o:p></o:p>

    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        <br /></div>
    <div class="MsoNoSpacing">
        On naming the company “Spanx”, she writes it was a
        branding decision. Sara had heard somewhere that names with a K in them sold
        well, so she came up with the name Spanks, a name that a lot of people in the
        Bible belt found too offensive. So she put the garments in a red box and
        changed the spelling to Spanx with an X – people were still offended, but she
        thought it was more fun. <o:p></o:p>

        First and foremost, there is the serial procrastinator. This
        is the one with a perennial approach of ‘Why make any decision today when I can
        put it off until tomorrow?’ The type: <b>‘SCREW IT – DO I REALLY HAVE TO
            DECIDE?’</b>

                IT – LET’S THINK SOME MORE ABOUT IT’</b></span>, probably the smartest all-round
        approach is what I like to call ‘the art of orchestrated procrastination’. This
        is an acquired discipline whereby the first thing to be addressed as part of
        the decision-making function is timing. Is it a ‘carpe diem’ situation or not?
        If you don’t seize the day, might the window of opportunity close or might it
        be filled by a start-up or existing competitor? <o:p></o:p>
