<p>Before we start with the summary, we ask - Why did Robert chose Fifty? Why Curtis Jackson?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the preface, explains that Fifty is the perfect example of his teachings in his last three books. Quoting Robert
    from the preface:</p>
<p>"With an open mind and the idea of figuring out what this book could be, I hung out with Fifty throughout much of
    2007. I was given almost complete access to his world. I followed him on numerous high-powered business meetings,
    sitting quietly in a corner and observing him in action. One day I witnessed a raucous fistfight in his office
    between two of his employees, with Fifty having to personally break it up. I observed a fake crisis that he
    manufactured for the press for publicity purposes. I followed him as he mingled with other stars, friends from the
    hood, European royalty, and political figures. I visited his childhood home in Southside Queens, hung out with his
    friends from his hustling days, and got a sense of what it could be like to grow up in that world. And the more I
    witnessed him in action on all these fronts, the more it struck me that Fifty was a walking, living example of the
    historical figures I had written about in my three books. He is a master player at power, a kind of hip-hop Napoleon
    Bonaparte."</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the introduction, Robert tries to explain what fear is by quoting Franklin Delano Roosevelt:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Fear creates its own self-fulfilling dynamic—as people give in to it, they lose energy and momentum. Their lack of
    confidence translates into inaction that lowers confidence levels even further, on and on. ‘So, first of all, let me
    assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror,
    which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.’”</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Robert gives examples of fearless personalities like…</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>An example of the fearless type would have to be the great abolitionist and writer Frederick Douglass, who was born
    into slavery in Maryland in 1817. As he later wrote, slavery was a system that depended on the creation of deep
    levels of fear. Douglass continually forced himself in the opposite direction. Despite the threat of severe
    punishment, he secretly taught himself to read and write. When he was whipped for his rebellious attitude, he fought
    back and saw that he was whipped less often. Without money or connections, he escaped to the North at the age of
    twenty. He became a leading abolitionist, touring the North and telling audiences about the evils of slavery. The
    abolitionists wanted him to stay on his lecture circuit and repeat the same stories over and over, but Douglass
    wanted to do much more and he once again rebelled. He founded his own antislavery newspaper, an unheard-of act for a
    former slave. The newspaper went on to have tremendous success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At each stage of his life Douglass was tested by the powerful odds against him. Instead of giving in to the fear—of
    whippings, being alone on the streets of unfamiliar cities, facing the wrath of the abolitionists—he raised his
    level of boldness and pushed himself further onto the offensive. This confidence gave him the power to rise above
    the fierce resistances and animosities of those around him. That is the physics that all fearless types discover at
    some point—an appropriate ratcheting up of self-belief and energy when facing negative or even impossible
    circumstances. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>And the Fifty Cent…</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The rapper known as 50 Cent (aka Curtis Jackson) would have to be considered one of the more dramatic contemporary
    examples of this phenomenon and this type. He grew up in a particularly violent and tense neighborhood—Southside
    Queens in the midst of the crack epidemic of the 1980s. And in each phase of his life he has had to face a series of
    dangers that both tested and toughened him, rituals of initiation into the fearless attitude he has slowly
    developed. </p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the greatest fears that any child has is that of being abandoned, left alone in a terrifying world. It is the
    source of our most primal nightmares. This was Fifty’s reality. He never knew his father, and his mother was
    murdered when he was eight years old. He quickly developed the habit of not depending on other people to protect or
    shelter him. This meant that in every subsequent encounter in life in which he felt fear, he could turn only to
    himself. If he did not want to feel the emotion, he had to learn to overcome it—on his own.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He began hustling on the streets at any early age, and there was no way he could avoid feeling fear. On a daily basis
    he had to confront violence and aggression. And seeing fear in action so routinely, he understood what a destructive
    and debilitating emotion it could be. On the streets, showing fear would make people lose respect for you. You would
    end up being pushed around and more likely to suffer violence because of your desire to avoid it. You had no
    choice—if you were to have any kind of power as a hustler, you had to overcome this emotion. No one could read it in
    your eyes. This meant that he would have to place himself again and again in the situations that stimulated anxiety.
    The first time he faced someone with a gun, he was frightened. The second time, less so. The third time, it meant
    nothing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Testing and proving his courage in this way gave him a feeling of tremendous power. He quickly learned the value of
    boldness, how he could push others on their heels by feeling supreme confidence in himself. But no matter how tough
    and hardened they become, hustlers usually face one daunting obstacle—the fear of leaving the streets that are so
    familiar and that have taught them all of their skills. They become addicted to the lifestyle, and even though they
    are likely to end up in prison or die an early death, they cannot leave the hustling racket.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fifty, however, had greater ambitions than to become merely a successful hustler, and so he forced himself to face
    and overcome this one powerful fear. At the age of twenty and at the peak of his hustling success, he decided to cut
    his ties to the game and dive into the music racket without any connections or a safety net. Because he had no plan
    B, because it was either succeed at music or go under, he operated with a frantic, bold energy that got him noticed
    in the rap world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was still a very young man when he had faced down some of the worst fears that can afflict a human—abandonment,
    violence, radical change—and he had emerged stronger and more resilient. But at the age of twenty-four, on the eve
    of the release of his first record, he came face-to-face with what many of us would consider the ultimate fear—that
    of death itself. In May of 2000 an assassin poured nine bullets into him in broad daylight as he sat in a car
    outside his house, one bullet going through his jaw and coming within a millimeter of killing him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the aftermath of the shooting, Columbia Records dropped him from the label, canceling the release of his first
    album. He was quickly blackballed from the industry, as record executives were afraid to have any kind of
    involvement with him and the violence he was associated with. Many of his friends turned against him, perhaps
    sensing his weakness. He now had no money; he couldn’t really return to hustling after turning his back on it, and
    his music career seemed to be over. This was one of those turning points that reveals the power of one’s attitude in
    the face of adversity. It was as if he were confronting the impassable Alps. At this moment, he did as Frederick
    Douglass did—he decided to ratchet up his anger, energy, and fearlessness. Coming so close to death, he understood
    how short life could be. He would not waste a second. He would spurn the usual path to success—working within the
    record industry, nabbing that golden deal, and putting out the music they thought would sell. He would go his own
    way—launching a mix-tape campaign in which he would sell his music or give it away for free on the streets. In this
    way he could hone the hard and raw sounds that he felt were more natural to him. He could speak the language of the
    hood without having to soften it at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suddenly he felt a great sense of freedom—he could create his own business model, be as unconventional as he desired.
    He felt like he had nothing to lose, as if the last bits of fear that still remained within him had bled out in the
    car that day in 2000. The mix-tape campaign made him famous on the streets and caught the attention of Eminem, who
    quickly signed Fifty to his and Dr. Dre’s label, setting the stage for Fifty’s meteoric rise to the top of the music
    world in 2003, and the subsequent creation of the business empire he has forged since.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are living through strange, revolutionary times. The old order is crumbling before our eyes on so many levels. And
    yet in such an unruly moment, our leaders in business and politics cling to the past and the old ways of doing
    things. They are afraid of change and any kind of disorder. The new fearless types, as represented by Fifty, move in
    the opposite direction. They find that the chaos of the times suits their temperament. They have grown up being
    unafraid of experimentation, hustling, and trying new ways of operating. They embrace the advances in technology
    that make others secretly fearful. They let go of the past and create their own business model. They do not give in
    to the conservative spirit that haunts corporate America in this radical period. And at the core of their success is
    a premise, a Law of Power that has been known and used by all the fearless spirits in the past and is the foundation
    of any kind of success in the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Now the 50th Law:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The 50th Law, however, states that there is one thing we can actually control—the mind-set with which we respond to
    these events around us. And if we are able to overcome our anxieties and forge a fearless attitude towards life,
    something strange and remarkable can occur—that margin of control over circumstance increases.</p>
<p>And the people who practice the 50th Law in their lives all share certain qualities—supreme boldness,
    unconventionality, fluidity, and a sense of urgency—that give them this unique ability to shape circumstance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chapter “1” is titled “See Things for What They Are-Intense Realism”. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>REALITY CAN BE RATHER HARSH. YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. IT TAKES CONSTANT EFFORT TO CARVE A PLACE FOR YOURSELF IN THIS
    RUTHLESSLY COMPETITIVE WORLD AND HOLD ON TO IT. PEOPLE CAN BE TREACHEROUS. THEY BRING ENDLESS BATTLES INTO YOUR
    LIFE. YOUR TASK IS TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO WISH IT WERE ALL DIFFERENT; INSTEAD YOU MUST FEARLESSLY ACCEPT THESE
    CIRCUMSTANCES, EVEN EMBRACE THEM. BY FOCUSING YOUR ATTENTION ON WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND YOU, YOU WILL GAIN A SHARP
    APPRECIATION FOR WHAT MAKES SOME PEOPLE ADVANCE AND OTHER FALL BEHIND. BY SEEING THROUGH PEOPLE’S MANIPULATIONS, YOU
    CAN TURN THEM AROUND. THE FIRMER YOUR GRASP ON REALITY, THE MORE POWER YOU WILL HAVE TO ALTER IT FOR YOUR PURPOSES.
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Keys to Fearlessness</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>KNOW THE OTHER, KNOW YOURSELF, AND THE VICTORY WILL NOT BE AT RISK; KNOW THE GROUND, KNOW THE NATURAL CONDITIONS, AND
    THE VICTORY WILL BE TOTAL. </p>
<p>–Sun Tzu</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STEP 1. REDISCOVER CURIOSITY—OPENNESS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>One day it came to the attention of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates that the oracle at Delphi had pronounced
    him the wisest man in the world. This baffled the philosopher—he did not think himself worthy of such a decree. It
    made him uncomfortable. He decided to simply go around Athens and find a person who was wiser than he—that should be
    easy and it would disprove the oracle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He engaged in many discussions with politicians, poets, craftsmen, and fellow philosophers. He began to realize that
    the oracle was right. All the people he talked to had such a certainty about things, venturing solid opinions about
    matters of which they had no experience; they were full of so much air. If you questioned them at all, they could
    not really defend their opinions, which seemed based on something they had decided years earlier. His superiority,
    he realized, was that he knew that he knew nothing. This left his mind open to experiencing things as they are, the
    source of all knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STEP 2. KNOW THE COMPLETE TERRAIN—EXPANSION</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>War is fought over specific terrain. But there is more involved than just that. There is also the morale of the enemy
    soldiers, the political leaders who set them in motion, the minds of the opposing generals who make the key
    decisions, and the money and resources that stand behind it all. A mediocre general will confine his knowledge to
    the physical terrain. A better general will try to expand his knowledge by reading reports about the other factors
    that influence an army. And the superior general will try to intensify this knowledge by observing as much as he can
    with his own eyes or consulting firsthand sources. Napoleon Bonaparte is the greatest general who ever lived, and
    what elevated him above all others was the mass of information he absorbed about all of the details of battle, with
    as few filters as possible. This gave him a superior grasp on reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STEP 3. DIG TO THE ROOTS—DEPTH</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This must be the power and the direction of your mind whenever you encounter some problem—to bore deeper and deeper
    until you get at something basic and at the root. Never be satisfied with what presents itself to your eyes. See
    what underlies it all, absorb it, and then dig deeper. Always question why this particular event has happened, what
    the motives of the various actors are, who really is in control, who benefits by this action. Often, it will revolve
    around money and power—that is what people are usually fighting over, despite the surface gloss they give to it. You
    may never get to the actual root, but the process of digging will bring you closer. And operating in this way will
    help develop your mind into a powerful analytical instrument.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STEP 4. SEE FURTHER AHEAD—PROPORTION</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have a long-term goal for yourself, one that you have imagined in detail, then you are better able to make the
    proper decisions in the present. You know which battles or positions to avoid because they don’t advance you towards
    your goal. With your gaze lifted to the future, you can focus on the dangers looming on the horizon and take
    proactive measures to avert them. You have a sense of proportion—sometimes the things we fuss over in the present
    don’t matter in the long run. All of this gives you an increased power to reach your objectives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STEP 5. LOOK AT PEOPLE’S DEEDS, NOT WORDS—SHARPNESS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In war or any competitive game, you don’t pay attention to people’s good or bad intentions. They don’t matter. It
    should be the same in the game of life. Everyone is playing to win, and some people will use moral justifications to
    advance their side. All you look at are people’s maneuvers —their actions in the past and what you might expect in
    the future. In this area, you are fiercely realistic. You understand that everyone is after power, and that to get
    it we all occasionally manipulate and even deceive. That is human nature and there is no shame in it. You don’t take
    people’s maneuvers personally; you merely try to defend or advance yourself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In general, looking at people through the lens of your emotions will cloud what you see and make you misunderstand
    everything. What you want is a sharp eye towards your fellow humans—one that is piercing, objective, and
    nonjudgmental.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STEP 6. REASSESS YOURSELF—DETACHMENT</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Your increasing powers of observation must occasionally be aimed at yourself. Think of this as a ritual you will
    engage in every few weeks—a rigorous reassessment of who you are and where you are headed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chapter 2 - Make Everything Your Own—Self-Reliance</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Look at a man like Rubin “Hurricane” Carter—a successful middleweight boxer who found himself arrested in 1966 at the
    height of his career and charged with a triple murder. The following year he was convicted and sentenced to three
    consecutive life terms. Through it all Carter vehemently maintained his innocence, and in 1986 he was finally
    exonerated of the crimes and set free. But for those nineteen years, he had to endure one of the most brutal
    environments known to man, one designed to break down every last vestige of autonomy.</p>
<p>Carter knew he would be freed at some point. But on the day of his release, would he walk the streets with a spirit
    crushed by years in prison? Would he be the kind of former prisoner who keeps coming back into the system because he
    can no longer do anything for himself?</p>
<p></p>
<p>He decided that he would defeat the system—he would use the years in prison to develop his self-reliance so that when
    he was freed it would mean something. For this purpose, he devised the following strategy: He would act like a free
    man while surrounded by walls. He would not wear their uniform or carry an ID badge. He was an individual, not a
    number. He would not eat with the other prisoners, do the assigned tasks, or go to his parole hearings. He was
    placed in solitary confinement for these transgressions but he was not afraid of the punishments, nor of being
    alone. He was afraid only of losing his dignity and sense of ownership.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of this strategy, he refused to have the usual entertainments in his cell—television, radio, pornographic
    magazines. He knew he would grow dependent on these weak pleasures and this would give the wardens something to take
    away from him. Also, such diversions were merely attempts to kill time. Instead he became a voracious reader of
    books that would help toughen his mind. He wrote an autobiography that gained sympathy for his cause. He taught
    himself law, determined to get his conviction overturned by himself. He tutored other prisoners in the ideas that he
    had learned through his reading. In this way, he reclaimed the dead time of prison for his own purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When he was eventually freed, he refused to take civil action against the state—that would acknowledge he had been in
    prison and needed compensation. He needed nothing. He was now a free man with the essential skills to get power in
    the world. After prison he became a successful advocate for prisoners’ rights and was awarded several honorary law
    degrees.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Think of it this way: dependency is a habit that is so easy to acquire. We live in a culture that offers you all
    kinds of crutches—experts to turn to, drugs to cure any psychological unease, mild pleasures to help pass or kill
    time, jobs to keep you just above water. It is hard to resist. But once you give in, it is like a prison you enter
    that you cannot ever leave. You continually look outward for help and this severely limits your options and
    maneuverability. When the time comes, as it inevitably does, when you must make an important decision, you have
    nothing inside of yourself to depend on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before it is too late, you must move in the opposite direction. You cannot get this requisite inner strength from
    books or a guru or pills of any kind. It can come only from you. It is a kind of exercise you must practice on a
    daily basis—weaning yourself from dependencies, listening less to others’ voices and more to your own, cultivating
    new skills. As happened with Carter, you will find that self-reliance becomes the habit and that anything that
    smacks of depending on others will horrify you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your life must be a progression towards ownership—first mentally of your independence, and then physically of your
    work, owning what you produce. Think of the following steps as a kind of blueprint for how to move in this
    direction.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b> STEP ONE: RECLAIM DEAD TIME </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Time is the critical factor in our lives, our most precious resource. The problem when we work for others is that so
    much of this becomes dead time that we want to pass as quickly as possible, time that is not our own.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STEP TWO: CREATE LITTLE EMPIRES</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>While still working for others, your goal at some point must be to carve out little areas that you can operate on
    your own, cultivating entrepreneurial skills. This could mean offering to take over projects that others have left
    undone or proposing to put into action some new idea of your own, but nothing too grandiose to raise suspicion. What
    you are doing is cultivating a taste for doing things yourself—making your own decisions, learning from your own
    mistakes. If you fail in this venture, then you have gained a valuable education. But generally taking on such
    things on your own initiative forces you to work harder and better. You are more creative and motivated because
    there is more at stake; you rise to the challenge.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STEP THREE: MOVE HIGHER UP THE FOOD CHAIN</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STEP FOUR: MAKE YOUR ENTERPRISE A REFLECTION OF YOUR INDIVIDUALITY</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 3 - Turn Shit into Sugar—Opportunism</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Events in life are not negative or positive. They are completely neutral. The universe does not care about your fate;
    it is indifferent to the violence that may hit you or to death itself. Things merely happen to you. It is your mind
    that chooses to interpret them as negative or positive. And because you have layers of fear that dwell deep within
    you, your natural tendency is to interpret temporary obstacles in your path as something larger— setbacks and
    crises.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In such a frame of mind, you exaggerate the dangers. If someone attacks and harms you in some way, you focus on the
    money or position you have lost in the battle, the negative publicity, or the harsh emotions that have been churned
    up. This causes you to grow cautious, to retreat, hoping to spare yourself more of these negative things. It is a
    time, you tell yourself, to lay low and wait for things to get better; you need calmness and security.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What you do not realize is that you are inadvertently making the situation worse. Your rival only gets stronger as
    you sit back; the negative publicity becomes firmly associated with you. Being conservative turns into a habit that
    carries over into less difficult moments. It becomes harder and harder to move to the offensive. In essence you have
    chosen to cast life’s inevitable twists of fortune as hardships, giving them a weight and endurance they do not
    deserve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What you need to do is take the opposite approach. Instead of becoming discouraged and depressed by any kind of
    downturn, you must see this as a wake-up call, a challenge that you will transform into an opportunity for power.
    Your energy levels rise. You move to the attack, surprising your enemies with boldness. You care less what people
    think about you and this paradoxically causes them to admire you—the negative publicity is turned around. You do not
    wait for things to get better —you seize this chance to prove yourself. Mentally framing a negative event as a
    blessing in disguise makes it easier for you to move forward. It is a kind of mental alchemy, transforming shit into
    sugar.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT YOU HAVE</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b> TURN ALL OBSTACLES INTO OPENINGS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>An opportunist in life sees all hindrances as instruments for power. The reason is simple: negative energy that comes
    at you in some form is energy that can be turned around—to defeat an opponent and lift you up. When there is no such
    energy, there is nothing to react or push against; it is harder to motivate yourself. Enemies that hit you have
    opened themselves up to a counterattack in which you control the timing and the dynamic. If bad publicity comes your
    way, think of it as a form of negative attention that you can easily reframe for your purposes. You can seem
    contrite or rebellious, whatever will stir up your base. If you ignore it, you look guilty. If you fight it, you
    seem defensive. If you go with it and channel it in your direction, you have turned it into an opportunity for
    positive attention. In general, obstacles force your mind to focus and find ways around them. They heighten your
    mental powers and should be welcomed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>LOOK FOR TURNING POINTS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Look for any sudden successes or failures in the business world that people find hard to explain. These are often
    indications of shifts going on under the surface; perhaps someone has inadvertently hit upon a new model for doing
    things and you must analyze this. Examine the greatest anxieties of those on the inside of any business or industry.
    Deep changes going on usually register as fear to those who do not know how to deal with them. You can be the first
    to exploit such changes for positive purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>MOVE BEFORE YOU ARE READY</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Most people wait too long to go into action, generally out of fear. They want more money or better circumstances. You
    must go the opposite direction and move before you think you are ready. It is as if you are making it a little more
    difficult for yourself, deliberately creating obstacles in your path. But it is a law of power that your energy will
    always rise to the appropriate level. When you feel that you must work harder to get to your goal because you are
    not quite prepared, you are more alert and inventive. This venture has to succeed and so it will.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember: as Napoleon said, the moral is to the physical as three to one—meaning the motivation and energy levels you
    or your army bring to the encounter have three times as much weight as your physical resources. With energy and high
    morale, a human can overcome almost any obstacle and create opportunity out of nothing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chapter 4 - Keep Moving—Calculated Momentum</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>IN THE PRESENT THERE IS CONSTANT CHANGE AND SO MUCH WE CANNOT CONTROL. IF YOU TRY TO MICROMANAGE IT ALL, YOU LOSE
    EVEN GREATER CONTROL IN THE LONG RUN. THE ANSWER IS TO LET GO AND MOVE WITH THE CHAOS THAT PRESENTS ITSELF TO
    YOU—FROM WITHIN IT, YOU WILL FIND ENDLESS OPPORTUNITIES THAT ELUDE MOST PEOPLE. DON’T GIVE OTHERS THE CHANCE TO PIN
    YOU DOWN; KEEP MOVING AND CHANGING YOUR APPEARANCES TO FIT THE ENVIRONMENT. IF YOU ENCOUNTER WALLS OR BOUNDARIES,
    SLIP AROUND THEM. DO NOT LET ANYTHING DISRUPT YOUR FLOW.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Life has a particular pace and rhythm, an endless stream of changes that can move slowly or quickly. When you try to
    stop this flow mentally or physically by holding on to things or people, you fall behind. Your actions become
    awkward because they are not in relation to present circumstances. It is like moving against a current as opposed to
    using it to propel you forward.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first and most important step is to let go of this need to control in such a direct manner. This means that you
    no longer see change and chaotic moments in life as something to fear, but rather as a source of excitement and
    opportunity. In a social situation in which you want the ability to influence people, your first move is to bend to
    their different energies. You see what they bring and you adapt to this, then find a way to divert their energy in
    your direction. You let go of the past way of doing things and adapt your strategies to the ever-flowing present.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Understand: momentum in life comes from increased fluidity, a willingness to try more, to move in a less constricted
    fashion. On many levels it remains something hard to put into words, but by understanding the process, becoming more
    conscious of the elements involved, you can place your mind in a readied position, better able to exploit any
    positive movement in your life. Call this calculated momentum. For this purpose, you must practice and master the
    following four types of flow.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>MENTAL FLOW</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Da Vinci remains the icon and the inspiration for a new form of knowledge. In this form, what matters are the
    connections between things, not what separates them. The mind has a particular momentum itself; when it heats up and
    discovers something new, it tends to find other items to study and illuminate. All of the greatest innovations in
    history come from an openness to discovery, one idea leading to another, sometimes coming from unrelated fields. You
    must develop this spirit and the same insatiable hunger for knowledge. This comes from widening your fields of study
    and observation, letting yourself be carried along by what you discover. You will find that you will come up with
    unexpected ideas, the kind that will lead to new practices or novel opportunities. If things run dry in your
    particular line of work, you have developed your mind along other lines that you can now exploit. Having such mental
    flow will allow you to constantly think around any obstacle and maintain your career momentum.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>EMOTIONAL FLOW</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Forgetting is a skill that you must develop in order to have emotional flow. If you cannot help but feel anger or
    disgust in the moment, make it a point to not let it remain the following day. When you hold on to emotions like
    that, it is as if you put blinders on your eyes. For that amount of time, you see and feel only what this emotion
    dictates, falling behind events. Your mind stops on feelings of failure, disappointment, and mistrust, giving you
    that awkwardness of someone out of tune with the moment. Without realizing it, all of your strategies become
    infected by these feelings, pushing you off course. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To combat this, you must learn the art of counterbalance. When you are fearful, force yourself to act in a bolder
    fashion than usual. When you feel inordinate hate, find some object of love or admiration that you can focus on with
    intensity. One strong emotion tends to cancel out the other and help you move past it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It might seem that intense feelings of love, hate, or anger can be used to impel you forward on some project, but
    that is an illusion. Such emotions give you a burst of energy that falls quickly and leaves you as low as you were
    high. Rather, you want a more balanced emotional life, with fewer highs and lows. This not only helps you keep
    moving and overcoming petty obstacles, but it also affects people’s perceptions of you. They come to see you as
    someone who has grace under pressure, a steady hand, and they will turn to you as a leader. Maintaining such
    steadiness will keep that positive flow in motion.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SOCIAL FLOW</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>About your model in any venture that involves groups of people: </p>
<p>You provide the framework, based on your knowledge and expertise, but you allow room for this project to be shaped by
    those involved in it. They are motivated and creative, helping to give the project more flow and force. You are not
    going too far in this process; you set the overall direction and tone. You are simply letting go of that fearful
    need to make people do exactly as you desire. In the long run, you will find that your ability to gently divert
    people’s energy in your direction gives you a wider range of control over the shape and result of the project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CULTURAL FLOW</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Understand: you exist in a particular cultural moment, with its own flow and style. When you are young you are more
    sensitive to these fluctuations in taste and so you generally keep up with the present. But as you get older the
    tendency is for you to become locked in a style that is dead, one that you associate with your youth and its
    excitement. If enough time passes, your style-lock can become quite ludicrous; you look like a museum piece. Your
    momentum will grind to a halt as people come to categorize you in a narrow period of time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead you must find a way to periodically reinvent yourself. You are not trying to mimic the latest trend—that will
    make you look equally ludicrous. You are simply rediscovering that youthful attentiveness to what is happening
    around you and incorporating what you like into a newer spirit. You are taking pleasure in shaping your personality,
    wearing a new mask. The only thing you really have to fear is becoming a social and cultural relic.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 5 - Know When to Be Bad—Aggression</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>THE WAY I LEARNED IT, THE KID IN THE SCHOOL YARD WHO DOESN’T WANT TO FIGHT ALWAYS LEAVES WITH A BLACK EYE. IF YOU
    INDICATE YOU’LL DO ANYTHING TO AVOID TROUBLE, THAT’S WHEN YOU GET TROUBLE. —50 Cent</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is how it is in life for everyone: people will take from you what they can. If they sense that you are the type
    of person who accepts and submits, they will push and push until they have established an exploitative relationship
    with you. Some will do this overtly; others are more slippery and passive aggressive. You must demonstrate to them
    that there are lines that cannot be crossed; they will pay a price for trying to push you around. This comes from
    your attitude—fearless and always prepared to fight. It radiates outward and can be read in your manner without you
    having to speak a word. By a paradoxical law of human nature, trying to please people less will make them more
    likely in the long run to respect and treat you better.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 6 - Lead from the Front—Authority</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>To master the art of leadership you must see yourself as playing certain parts that will impress your disciples and
    make them more likely to follow you with the necessary enthusiasm. The following are the four main roles you must
    learn to perform.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1: THE VISIONARY</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2: THE UNIFIER</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A group needs a centripetal force to give it unity and cohesion but it is not enough to have that be you and the
    force of your personality. Instead it should be a cause that you fearlessly embody. This could be political,
    ethical, or progressive—you are working to improve the lives of people in your community, for instance. This cause
    elevates your group above others. It has a quasi-religious aura to it, a kind of cult feeling. Now, to fight or
    doubt you from within is to stand against this cause and seem selfish. The group, infused with this belief system,
    will tend to police itself and root out troublemakers. To play this role effectively, you must be a living example
    of this cause.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3: THE ROLE MODEL</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>4: THE BOLD KNIGHT</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A DISTINGUISHED COMMANDER WITHOUT BOLDNESS IS UNTHINKABLE. NO MAN WHO IS NOT…BOLD CAN PLAY SUCH A ROLE, AND THEREFORE
    WE CONSIDER THIS QUALITY THE FIRST PREREQUISITE OF THE GREAT MILITARY LEADER. HOW MUCH OF THIS QUALITY REMAINS BY
    THE TIME HE REACHES SENIOR RANK, AFTER TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE HAVE AFFECTED AND MODIFIED IT, IS ANOTHER QUESTION.
    THE GREATER THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT IS RETAINED, THE GREATER THE RANGE OF HIS GENIUS. —Carl bon Clausewitz</p>
<p></p>
<p><b> CHAPTER 7 - Know Your Environment from the Inside Out—Connection</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>MOST PEOPLE THINK FIRST OF WHAT THEY WANT TO EXPRESS OR MAKE, THEN FIND THE AUDIENCE FOR THEIR IDEA. YOU MUST WORK
    THE OPPOSITE ANGLE, THINKING FIRST OF THE PUBLIC. YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR FOCUS ON THEIR CHANGING NEEDS, THE TRENDS
    THAT ARE WASHING THROUGH THEM. BEGINNING WITH THEIR DEMAND, YOU CREATE THE APPROPRIATE SUPPLY. DO NOT BE AFRAID OF
    PEOPLE’S CRITICISMS—WITHOUT SUCH FEEDBACK YOUR WORK WILL BE TOO PERSONAL AND DELUSIONAL. YOU MUST MAINTAIN AS CLOSE
    A RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR ENVIRONMENT AS POSSIBLE, GETTING AN INSIDE “FEEL” FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND YOU. NEVER
    LOSE TOUCH WITH YOUR BASE.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All living creatures depend for their survival on their relationship to their environment. If they are particularly
    sensitive to any kind of change—a danger or an opportunity—they have greater power to dominate their surroundings.
    It is not simply that the hawk can see farther than any other creature, but that it can see great detail, picking
    out the slightest alteration in the landscape. Its eyes give it tremendous sensitivity and supreme hunting prowess.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We live in an environment that is mostly human. It consists of the people that we interact with day in and day out.
    These humans come from many varied backgrounds and cultures. They are individuals with their own unique experiences.
    To know people well—their differences, their nuances, their emotional life—would give us a great sense of connection
    and power. We would know how to reach them, communicate more effectively, and influence their actions. But so often
    we remain on the outside and lack this power. To connect to the environment in this way would mean having to move
    outside ourselves, train our eyes on people, but so often we prefer to live in our heads, amid our own thoughts and
    dreams. We strive to make everything in the world familiar and simple. We grow insensitive to people’s differences,
    to the details that make them individuals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are social creatures who make things in order to communicate and connect with those around us. Your goal must be
    to break down the distance between you and your audience, the base of your support in life. Some of this distance is
    mental—it comes from your ego and the need to feel superior. Some of it is physical—the nature of your business
    tends to shut you off from the public with layers of bureaucracy. In any event, what you are seeking is maximum
    interaction, allowing you to get a feel for people from the inside. You come to thrive off their feedback and
    criticism. Operating this way, what you produce will not fail to resonate because it will come from the inside. This
    deep level of interaction is the source of the most powerful and popular works in culture and business, and a
    political style that truly connects. </p>
<p>The following are four strategies you can use to bring yourself closer to this ideal.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1. CRUSH ALL DISTANCE</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2. OPEN INFORMAL CHANNELS OF CRITICISM AND FEEDBACK</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3. RECONNECT WITH YOUR BASE</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>4. CREATE THE SOCIAL MIRROR</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Alone, in our minds, we can imagine we have all kinds of powers and abilities. Our egos can inflate to any size. But
    when we produce something that fails to have the expected impact, we are suddenly faced with a limit— we are not as
    brilliant or skilled as we had imagined. In such a case, our tendency is to blame others for not understanding it or
    getting in our way. Our egos are bruised and delicate—criticism from the outside seems like a personal attack, which
    we cannot endure. We tend to close ourselves off and this makes it doubly difficult to succeed with our next
    venture. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of turning inward, consider people’s coolness to your idea and their criticisms as a kind of mirror they are
    holding up to you. A physical mirror turns you into an object; you can see yourself as others see you. Your ego
    cannot protect you—the mirror does not lie. You use it to correct your appearance and avoid ridicule. The opinions
    of other people serve a similar function. You view your work from inside your mind, encrusted with all kinds of
    desires and fears. They see it as an object; they see it as it is. Through their criticisms you can get closer to
    this objective version and gradually improve what you do. (One caveat: beware of feedback from friends whose
    judgments could be tainted by feelings of envy or the need to flatter.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b> CHAPTER 8 - Respect the Process—Mastery</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>THE FOOLS IN LIFE WANT THINGS FAST AND EASY-MONEY, SUCCESS, ATTENTION. BOREDOM IS THEIR GREAT ENEMY AND FEAR.
    WHATEVER THEY MANAGE TO GET SLIPS THROUGH THEIR HANDS AS FAST AS IT COMES IN. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, WANT TO
    OUTLAST YOUR RIVALS. YOU ARE BUILDING THE FOUNDATION FOR SOMETHING THAT CAN CONTINUE TO EXPAND. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN,
    YOU WILL HAVE TO SERVE AN APPRENTICESHIP. YOU MUST LEARN EARLY ON TO ENDURE THE HOURS OF PRACTICE AND DRUDGERY,
    KNOWING THAT IN THE END ALL OF THAT TIME WILL TRANSLATE INTO A HIGHER PLEASURE—MASTERY OF A CRAFT AND OF YOURSELF.
    YOUR GOAL IS TO REACH THE ULTIMATE SKILL LEVEL—AN INTUITIVE FEEL FOR WHAT MUST COME NEXT.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>ALL OF MAN’S TROUBLES COME FROM NOT KNOWING HOW TO SIT STILL, ALONE IN A ROOM. —Blaise Pascal</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following are five principal strategies for developing the proper relationship to process.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1. PROGRESS THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2. MASTER SOMETHING SIMPLE </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3. INTERNALIZE THE RULES OF THE GAME</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>4. ATTUNE YOURSELF TO THE DETAILS </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>5. REDISCOVER YOUR NATURAL PERSISTENCE</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b> CHAPTER 9 - Push Beyond Your Limits—Self-Belief</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>YOUR SENSE OF WHO YOU ARE WILL DETERMINE YOUR ACTIONS AND WHAT YOU END UP GETTING IN LIFE. IF YOU SEE YOUR REACH AS
    LIMITED, THAT YOU ARE MOSTLY HELPLESS IN THE FACE OF SO MANY DIFFICULTIES, THAT IT IS BEST TO KEEP YOUR AMBITIONS
    LOW, THEN YOU WILL RECEIVE THE LITTLE THAT YOU EXPECT. KNOWING THIS DYNAMIC, YOU MUST TRAIN YOURSELF FOR THE
    OPPOSITE—ASK FOR MORE, AIM HIGH, AND BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE DESTINED FOR SOMETHING GREAT. YOUR SENSE OF SELF-WORTH
    COMES FROM YOU ALONE—NEVER THE OPINION OF OTHERS. WITH A RISING CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ABILITIES, YOU WILL TAKE RISKS
    THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS. PEOPLE FOLLOW THOSE WHO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE GOING, SO CULTIVATE AN AIR
    OF CERTAINTY AND BOLDNESS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>---</p>
<p></p>
<p>YOUR OPINION OF YOURSELF BECOMES YOUR REALITY. IF YOU HAVE ALL THESE DOUBTS, THEN NO ONE WILL BELIEVE IN YOU AND
    EVERYTHING WILL GO WRONG. IF YOU THINK THE OPPOSITE, THE OPPOSITE WILL HAPPEN. IT’S THAT SIMPLE. —50 Cent</p>
<p></p>
<p>What block us from moving in the direction of self-belief are the pressures we feel to conform; our rigid, habitual
    patterns of thinking; and our self-doubts and fears. The following are five strategies to help you push past these
    limits.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1. DEFY ALL CATEGORIES</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Understand: the day you were born you became engaged in a struggle that continues to this day and will determine your
    success or failure in life. You are an individual, with ideas and skills that make you unique. But people are
    constantly trying to fit you into narrow categories that make you more predictable and easier to manage. They want
    to see you as shy or outgoing, sensitive or tough. If you succumb to this pressure, then you may gain some social
    acceptance, but you will lose the unconventional parts of your character that are the source of your uniqueness and
    power. You must resist this process at all costs, seeing people’s neat and tidy judgments as a form of confinement.
    Your task is to retain or rediscover those aspects of your character that defy categorization, and to give them even
    greater play. Remaining unique, you will create something unique and inspire the kind of respect you would never
    receive from tepid conformity.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b> 2. CONSTANTLY REINVENT YOURSELF </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3. SUBVERT YOUR PATTERNS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>What often prevent us from using the mental fluidity and freedom that we naturally possess are the physical routines
    in our lives. We see the same people and do the same things, and our minds follow these patterns. The solution then
    is to break this up. For instance, we could deliberately indulge in some random, even irrational act, perhaps doing
    the very opposite of what we would normally do in our day-to-day life. By taking an action we have never done
    before, we place ourselves in unfamiliar territory—our minds naturally awaken to the novel situation. In a similar
    vein, we can force ourselves to take different routes, visit strange places, encounter different people, wake up at
    odd hours, or read books that challenge our minds instead of dull them. We should practice this when we feel
    particularly blocked and uncreative. In such moments, it is best to be ruthless with ourselves and our patterns.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>4. CREATE A SENSE OF DESTINY</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The higher your self-belief, the more your power to transform reality. Having supreme confidence makes you fearless
    and persistent, allowing you to overcome obstacles that stop most people in their tracks. It makes others believe in
    you as well. And the most intense form of self-belief is to feel a sense of destiny impelling you forward. This
    destiny can come from otherworldly sources or it can come from yourself. Think of it in these terms: you have a set
    of skills and experiences that make you unique. They point towards some life task that you were meant to accomplish.
    You see signs of this in the predilections of your youth, certain tasks you were naturally drawn to. When you are
    involved in this task, everything seems to flow more naturally. Believing you are destined to accomplish something
    does not make you passive or unfree, but the opposite. You are liberated of the normal doubts and confusions that
    plague us. You have a sense of purpose that guides you but does not chain you to one way of doing things. And when
    your willpower is so deeply engaged, it will push you past any limits or dangers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>5. BET ON YOURSELF</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 10 - Confront Your Mortality—the Sublime</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>IN THE FACE OF OUR INEVITABLE MORTALITY WE CAN DO ONE OF TWO THINGS. WE CAN ATTEMPT TO AVOID THE THOUGHT AT ALL
    COSTS, CLINGING TO THE ILLUSION THAT WE HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD. OR WE CAN CONFRONT THIS REALITY, ACCEPT AND
    EVEN EMBRACE IT, CONVERTING OUR CONSCIOUSNESS OF DEATH INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE AND ACTIVE. IN ADOPTING SUCH A
    FEARLESS PHILOSOPHY, WE GAIN A SENSE OF PROPORTION, BECOME ABLE TO SEPARATE WHAT IS PETTY FROM WHAT IS TRULY
    IMPORTANT. KNOWING OUR DAYS TO BE NUMBERED, WE HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY AND MISSION. WE CAN APPRECIATE LIFE ALL THE
    MORE FOR ITS IMPERMANENCE. IF WE CAN OVERCOME THE FEAR OF DEATH, THEN THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO FEAR.</p>
<p></p>
