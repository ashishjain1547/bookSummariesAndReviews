We have picked some bestsellers that have helped people the world over chalk out a retirement plan.

Financial planning can be easy if you have the right tools. We pick here some bestsellers that have helped people the world over chalk out a retirement plan. Use them to fish out important guideposts, not just India-specific information.

1. ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO CAREFREE RETIREMENT

Author: Gaurav Mashruwala
Publisher: Businessworld

The book looks at retirement planning for every age group and ways to manage money after the golden handshake. Apart from details on financial products available in India that can be used for an effective retirement, it uses case studies. These worked out examples help readers make an easy association.

2. GUIDE TO PLANNING YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE

Authors: Kenneth & Virginia Morris
Publisher: Lightbulb Library

This illustrated book simplifies the basic retirement planning concepts. Although retirement in India doesn’t work the same way as in the US, this book—part of a series—gives relevant pointers that can apply anywhere in the world. A handy, easy-to-read guide.

3. COMPLETE RETIREMENT GUIDEBOOK

Authors: Glenn Ruffenach
And Kelly Greene
Publisher: Three Rivers

The authors have been writing about retirement issues for The Wall Street Journal for long and have gone beyond the nuts and bolts of retirement in this book. It is replete with examples and worksheets that can help you plan your later years. It’s an American book, but has concepts that can be adapted to local conditions.

4. THE NEW RETIREMENTALITY

Author: Mitch Anthony
Publisher: Kaplan

The cleverly named book and the concept should be of interest to anyone uneasy with the traditional requirement of ending a working life at 60. Anecdotes about those who have done so, and a liberal sprinkling of inspirational suggestions from the author make the book meaningful. Read it to know how to make your desires come true after retirement.

5. GETTING STARTED IN RETIREMENT PLANNING

Authors: Ronald and Murry Yolles
Publisher: John Wiley and Sons

This book offering a simple strategy is split in four parts. It starts with the need for retirement savings, followed by a strategy for each lifestage, and for preserving wealth. Finally, it looks at the good life after retirement. The hypothetical scenarios offer realistic solutions for a range of retirement issues.

6. RETIRE YOUNG, RETIRE RICH

Authors: Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter
Publisher: Business Plus

Kiyosaki is the Oprah of finance. In this book, the fifth in the Rich Dad series, he and Lechter stress on the power of leverage. They cite their own situation of starting with nothing and retiring financially free in less than 10 years. An amazing feat and an example we can aspire to.

7. THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO RETIREMENT PLANNING

Author: Jeffrey J. Wuorio
Publisher: Alpha

The book stresses on the need for enough money after retirement and the benefits that the US social security offers—or the lack thereof—and ways to supplement them. Again, it has nothing for the Indian context, but one can take lessons from the state pension schemes and the way they pan out.

8. YES, YOU CAN STILL RETIRE COMFORTABLY

Authors: Ben Stein, Phil Demuth
Publisher: New Beginnings Press

Backed by facts and figures, the book shows exactly how much you need to save to maintain your standard of living, and how to invest to get the maximum returns from your savings. It offers tips to tap into the nest egg after you retire—in a way that you get the most money while keeping it safe.

9. START LATE FINISH RICH

Author: David Bach
Publisher: Broadway

Going by the title, one can retire rich no matter what the starting point. However, the book is only useful for those who are under 45. Anyone who reads it after this age will find it highly unsuitable. The premise of the book is that one should focus more on cutting costs than being investment-driven. Incidentally, one of Bach’s suggestions is to cut eating out!

10. WHAT COLOR IS YOUR PARACHUTE?

Authors: Richard N. Bolles
And John Nelson
Publisher: Ten Speed

The book starts by stating that retirement today is not like the past, when it was all about money. This one is for those looking at life in retirement—it has to do with what one wants and how to get there. But, be warned. This is not really a personal finance book; it’s close to psychology.
