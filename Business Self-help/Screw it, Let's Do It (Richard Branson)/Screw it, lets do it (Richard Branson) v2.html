This post is about the book “Screw it, let’s do it” by Richard Branson. We are going to cover the best lessons that are presented in this book by the author.

The first lesson that Richard talks about is <b>“Take The First Step”</b>.
Plato once said, 'The beginning is the most important part of any work.' A journey of a thousand miles starts with that first step. If you look ahead to the end, and all the weary miles between, with all the dangers you might face, you might never take that first step. And whatever it is you want to achieve in life, if you don't make the effort, you won't reach your goal. So take the first step. 

Second is <b>“Believe It Can Be Done”</b>.
Richard’s mum, Eve, is a perfect example of this.

During the war, she wanted to be a pilot. She went to Heston airfield and asked for a job. She was told only men could be pilots. Eve was very pretty and had been a dancer on stage. She didn't look like a man. That didn't stop her. She wore a leather flying jacket and hid her blonde hair under a leather helmet. She talked with a deep voice. And she got the job she wanted. She learned how to glide and began to teach the new pilots. These were the young men who flew fighter planes in the Battle of Britain. 

After the war, she wanted to be an air hostess. Back then, they had to speak Spanish and be trained as nurses, but Eve chatted up the night porter at the airline and he secretly put her name on the list. Soon, she was an air hostess. She still couldn’t speak Spanish and she wasn’t a nurse. But she had used her wits. She wouldn’t say no. She just did it.

Third is about the <b>“Birth of Virgin Music”</b> and the lesson <b>“Have Fun and Money Will Come”</b>.

Throughout 1977, Richard had been working on making something out of Virgin Music. By the end of the year, Richard needed a break. His girlfriend, Joan and he had split up. He was sad but he likes to make the best of things. He always likes to get away from London in the winter. Music, sun and sea makes him feel good. 

The distance from London gives him the space and freedom to think and plan out fresh ideas. He went to Jamaica. It was part holiday, part work. He swam in a worm sea. He sat on the beach. He listened to some great reggae bands. Then he heard a new kind of music. It was made by local DJs and radio jocks, who were known as `toasters'. It was a kind of early rap, so he was at the start of something big. Jamaican musicians won't take checks so he signed up almost twenty reggae bands and some toasters from a case filled with cash. They went on to sell lots of records with them. It was a perfect example of his motto — have fun and the money will come. 

Now a touch of reality:

If you do have to work for a boss at a job you don't like, as almost everyone does at some point, don't moan about it. Have a positive outlook on life and just get on with it. Work hard and earn your pay. Enjoy the people you come into contact with through your job. And if you are still unhappy, make it instead your goal to divide your private life from your work life. Have fun in your own time, you will feel happier and you'll enjoy your life and your job more. 

Next is: <b>Be bold. Calculate the risks and take them.</b>

In 2004 Richard made a TV series, The rebel Billionaire. The final episode had a twist at the end. Richard offered the prize winner, Shawn Nelson, a check for one million dollars - but there was a catch. He could take the check or toss a coin for an even bigger mystery prize. If he lost the toss, he would lose it all. Richard held out the check. Shawn took it and saw the long line of zeros. Then Richard took it back, put it in his hip pocket and held out a silver coin. 

'Which one will it be?' Richard said. 'The coin or the check?'
Life is full of hard choices. Which one would Shawn go for? Shawn looked shaken. It was a huge gamble. All or nothing. He asked Richard, 'what would you do?' 'It's up to you,' Richard said. Richard could have told him that he takes risks, but they are calculated risks. He weighs the odds in everything he does. Instead, Richard said nothing. 

Shawn had to make up his own mind. Shawn walked back and forth, trying to decide. It was tempting to gamble. It would make him look cool. Also, the unknown prize might be amazing. At last, he said he couldn't risk losing that much money on the toss of a coin. He owned a small company. He could use the money wisely to help his business grow. It could change his life for the better. It would also help the people who worked for him and believed in him. 'I'll take the check, ' he said. 

Richard was pleased and told him 'If you had gone for the coin toss, I would have lost all respect for you'. 

He made the right choice and didn't gamble on something that he couldn't control. He got the million dollars but not the mystery prize. The big prize was to be president of Virgin for three months. Virgin has 200 companies so Shawn would have learnt a lot. It was a golden chance. Richard does say that 'Believe in yourself. You can do it' but he also says, <b>'Be bold but don't gamble.'</b>  

The next lesson is: <b>Challenge yourself</b>.</pre>

<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Everyone needs something to aim for. You can call it a
    challenge, or you can call it a goal. It is what makes us human. It was
    challenges that took us from being caveman to reaching for the stars. If you
    challenge yourself, you will grow. Your life will change. Your outlook will be
    positive. It's not always easy to reach your goal but that's no reason to stop.
    Never say die. Say yourself 'I can do it. I'll keep on trying until I win.'&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Ricky’s First Big Challenge:</div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Ricky’s first big challenge was when he was five years
    old. He went to Devon for two weeks one summer with family and relatives. When
    they got there, he ran onto the beach and started at the sea, he couldn’t swim
    and his aunt Joyce bet him ten shillings that he couldn’t learn to swim by the
    end of the holiday. Ricky took the bet.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Most days, the sea was rough and the waves were high, but
    Ricky tried for hours. Day after day, he splashed along with one foot on the
    bottom. He grew blue with cold and swallowed a lot of sea water but still he
    couldn’t swim.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Ricky had lost the bet and his aunt told him to never
    mind as there is always a next year.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    As they set off for home in the car, Ricky gazed out of
    the window. He wished he had learned to swim, he hated losing the bet. And, the
    family hadn’t got home so they were still really on holiday. Ricky thought, now
    was his last chance.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    “Stop the car,” he shouted. His dad followed as both of
    his parents knew about the bet and they obviously knew their son. Ricky jumped
    out of the car, stripped quickly, and ran across a field to the river. When
    Ricky turned his head, he saw everyone standing and watching him, his mum
    smiled, waved and called out “You can do it, Ricky”. As soon as Ricky got in
    the middle, the current caught him. He went under, choked, came up and swept
    downstream. He put one foot on a rock and pushed off, and soon he was swimming.
    He swain in an awkward circle, but he’d won the bet.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Next: Stand on
    your feet.</div>

<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">

    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Lessons like these, taught to Richard by his mum from
    when he was a toddler, are what have made him stand on his own two feet. He was
    trained to think for himself and get things done. </div>

<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Stand on your feet (The Virgin Story)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    Although Richard relies on himself and believes in his
    goals, he lost faith in himself once. In 1986, Richard was told that he should
    take Virgin public. Two of his partners who knew him well, were not very keen.
    They said he would hate losing control.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    But the bankers said it was a good idea. It would give him
    more capital to work with. Other big private companies, like Body Shop and Sock
    Shop, had gone public. They were doing well. Pushed hard by the bankers, Richard
    launched Virgin on the stock exchange.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Around 70,000 people applied for shares by post. Those
    who had left it too late lined up in the city to buy shares in person. Richard
    writes he will never forget walking up the long line of people to thank them
    for their faith in him. He was very moved when they said things like, 'We're
    not going holiday this year, we're putting our savings in Virgin' and, 'We're
    banking on you, Richard.' </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    But it wasn’t long though that he realized he had made a
    mistake. Now instead of having casual meetings on his houseboat to discuss what
    bands to sign, he had to ask board of directors for a meeting for which he
    would usually have to wait for four weeks. Plus, these people had no idea what
    music business was all about.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    They didn't see how a hit record could make millions
    overnight. Richard could not sign someone who was hot before his rivals did. Or
    they'd say things like, 'Sign the Rolling Stones? My wife doesn't like them.
    Janet Jackson? Who's she?' </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Richard has always made fast decisions and acted on his
    instinct. But now, he was stifled. Most of all, he no longer felt that he was
    standing on his own feet. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Then, there was a huge stock-market crash. Richard felt
    that he was letting down all the people who had bought Virgin shares. Many were
    friends and family as well as Virgin’s staff. But many were like the couple who
    had given him their life savings.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Then, Richard made up his mind. He would buy all the
    shares back — at the price everyone had paid for them. He didn't have to pay
    that much, but he didn't want to let people down. He raised the £182 million
    needed and Virgin became private company again.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    After this Richard writes, “I felt nothing but relief.
    Once again, I was the captain of my ship and master of my fate. I believe in
    myself. I believe in the hands that work, in the brains that think, and in the
    hearts that love.”</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Next: Live the moment!</div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Richard’s grandmother lived life to the full. At the age
    of 89 she became the oldest person in Britain to pass the advanced Latin
    American ballroom-dancing exam. She was ninety when she became the oldest
    person to hit a hole in one at golf. She never stopped learning. In her mid-90s
    she read Stephen Hawking's book, A Brief History of Time, which may make her
    one of the few people to have read it all the way through! Shortly before her
    death at the age of 99 she went on a cruise around in Jamaica wearing only her
    swimming costume. Her attitude was that you've only got one go in life, so you
    should make the most of it. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    About having regrets, Richard writes:</div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    In a way, regrets are like wanting the peach you have
    thrown away. It’s gone, but you are filled with remorse. You wish you hadn't
    thrown it away. You want it back. Richard believes that the one thing that
    helps is to have no regrets. Regrets weigh you down. They hold you back in the
    past when you should move on. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    About living in the future:</div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Always living in the future can slow us down as much as
    always looking behind. Many people are always looking ahead and they never seem
    content. They look for quick fixes, like winning the lottery. Goals are
    important. Money is important. But the bottom line is money is just a means to
    an end, not an end in itself. And what is going on now is just as important as
    what you're planning for the future. So, even though Richard’s diary is full
    for months ahead, he has learned to live for the moment.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Next: Value
    friends and family.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    If anyone asks Richard what he believes in above all
    else, he would say his family. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    And it is true that sometimes families split up. Then,
    some people don't have anyone. But close friends can be like a family. We all
    need a strong support network. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Even though Richard was taught to stand on his own feet, Richard
    writes, “without my loyal family and friends, I would be lost”. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
Next: <b>Have respect.</b></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    One time Richard had to go to a meeting. He was already
    late, so he grabbed some papers and jumped into a taxi. On the way, the driver
    got very chatty. He had recognized him and said “I know you. You're that Rick
    Branson. You've got a record label.” And after that, the cabby would not shut
    up. He told Ricky that he might be a cabby by the day but he was also a drummer
    in a band.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    He asked if Richard would like to hear his demo tape.
    Richard’s heart sank. People were always playing tapes to him in the hopes they
    would be discovered. But Rick didn't want to be rude. 'That would be lovely,'
    he said. The cabby had house around the corner and he had got Richard to accept
    his offer for tea, and just outside this house when Richard heard 'I can feel
    it, coming in the air tonight...' coming from the speakers. Cabby jumped out of
    the front seat and held the door open for Rick. The cab driver was Phil
    Collins, laughing like mad.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    When Richard made “The Rebel Billionaire”, he copied the
    idea from Phil. He made himself look like an old cabby and drove the young
    contestants to the manor house. Rick had his ears peeled and listened to what
    they said in the back. Rick also noted how they treated an old man who couldn't
    lift heavy cases. Rick learned a lot about them from that, much to their
    dismay. Respect is about how you treat everyone, not just those you want to
    impress.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    It is very important to always keep eyes and ears open
    and to be polite. They say that you never know who might hear or see you. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Is money root of all evil?</div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    It's said that money is root of all evil, but it doesn't
    have to be. Money can be used for good. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    The biggest charities in the world were started by rich
    men and women, but some were begun with next to nothing. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    Harvard, the wealthiest college in America, is a
    charitable trust. It started with a few books and just £350. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    IKEA started in a garden shed. Its parent company is a
    charitable trust. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br /></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">
    The man who dreamed up the Big Mac started life selling
    paper cups. His company now gives $50 million a year to charity. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px;" trbidi="on">

<pre>An excerpt from Chapter 2 - Be Bold:
Richard writes:
I get sent thousand of ideas each week – they are people’s goals and dreams. There are too many for me to look at. My staff read them first and weed them out. I look at the best ones.

One plan I was offered ended in disaster. I was young. My urge to try anything almost killed me. Sadly, it killed the inventor.

A man called Richard Ellis sent me a photo of his ‘flying machine’. It had a three-wheeledbike beneath two large wings. It was powered by a small outboard engine. There were rotors above the pilot’s head. The photo showed a man soaring above the treetops. I was curious and I invited him to show me how it worked.

When he came, we went to the local airfield with Joan and some friends. He took his machine to a landing strip. You had to pedal like mad to get speed up. Then the engine would cut in and start the rotors. He said I would be second person to try it. But he didn’t want me to fly.

‘You need to get used to it first,’ he said.

It looked like fun. I sat on machine. He gave me a cable with a rubber switch at end, which went in mouth. I had to bite on the switch to make the engine cut out. I would stop at the end of the runway before I took off. ‘Ok! Go!’ Ellis shouted.
I put the cable in my mouth and set off down the runway. I pedaled like hell. The engine kicked in. I went faster and faster. When it seemed fast enough, I bit into the switch to stop. Nothing happened. I went even faster. I bit harder. Nothing. I reached thirty miles an hour. I could see Joan looking at me at the endof the runway as I got closer. Suddenly, I rose into the air. The flying machine took off, with me hanging on. I was flying.
I soared over some trees. I rose higher. When I was at one hundred feet, I knew I had to stop it somehow. I tugged at wires and pulled them out. I burned my hands on the hot engine but at last the engine cut out and I spun down to the ground. At the very last moment, a small gust of wind flipped the machine over. Flipped the machine over. A wing took the Impact. I fell out onto the grass. I was safe but shocked. 

A week later, Ellis took off in the flying machine. It crashed to earth. He died on Impact. His death was sad, but people with vision do die. Mountain climbers fall, and test pilots crash. As a child, I knew the war hero, Douglas Bader. He was a friend of my aunt Clare’s. He lost his legs in a flying accident. He learned to walk and also flew again. You can take care and try to avoid the risks, but you can’t protect yourself all the time. I am sure that luck plays a very large part. It’s easy to give up when things are hard but I believe we have to keep chasing our dreams and our goals, as these exciting people did. <b>And once we decided to do something, we should never look back, never regret it.</b>
